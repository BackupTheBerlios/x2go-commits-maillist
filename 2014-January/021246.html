 Introduction
 ============
     With Python X2go you can write your own X2go clients or embed X2go client 
-    suport into already existing application environments.

 API Concept
 ===========
 
-    Python X2go consists of quite a few classes. Furthermore, Python X2go is quite heavily 
-    taken advantage of Python threading features. As, when providing a library like Python
-    X2go, it is always quite a task to keep the library code compatible with former versions
-    of the same library. This intended for Python X2go, but with some restraints.

-    Python X2go only offers 5 public API classes. Once version 0.1.0 has been released, we

+    has been released, we will try to keep these 5 public API classes 
+    as compatible as possible to former versions of Python X2go.
 
     These classes are:
 
         - L{X2goClient} --- a whole X2go client API
-        - L{X2goRegisteredSession} --- management of an individual X2go session
-        - L{X2goClientSettings} --- access to X2go (global and user) config file(s) &#187;settings&#171;
-        - L{X2goClientPrinting} --- access to X2go (global and user) config file(s) &#187;printing&#171;
-        - L{X2goSessionProfiles} --- access to X2go (global and user) config file(s) &#187;sessions&#171;
+        - L{X2goRegisteredSession} --- management of an individual X2go 
+        session started from an L{X2goClient} instance
+        - L{X2goClientSettings} --- provide access to X2go (global and 
+        user) config file(s) &#187;settings&#171;
+        - L{X2goClientPrinting} --- provide access to X2go (global and

+        user) config file(s) &#187;sessions&#171;
 
-    Any other of the Python X2go classes may be subject to internal changes and they way of 
-    addressing these classes in code may vary between versions. If you use them, so please be warned.

 API Structure

 Configuration and Session Management
 ====================================
 
-    Python X2go strictly separates configuration management from session management. The classes needed
-    for session management / administration are supposed to only &#187;read access&#171; to the classes handling the
-    X2go client configuration files. Each configuration file will be re-read whenever it is needed by 
-    an X2go sesion or the X2goClient class itself. Conclusively, any change to either of the configuration files

+
+    NOTE: Each configuration file will be re-read whenever it is needed 
+    by an X2go sesion or the X2goClient class itself. 
+
+    Conclusively, any change to either of the configuration files
     will be reflected as a change in your X2go client behaviour:
 
-      - X2goSessionProfiles: changing a session profile in the &#187;sessions&#171; file will be available for 
-        the next registered X2goRegisteredSession instance
-      - X2goClientPrinting: on each incoming X2go print job the &#187;printing&#171; configuration file will be re-read, 
-        thus you can change your X2go client's print setup during a running session
-      - X2goClientSettings: also the configuration file &#187;settings&#171; is re-read whenever needed in the course of 
-        X2go session management
-      - X2goXServer (Windows only): this class will only be initialized once (starting the XServer on Windows
-        platforms) on construction of an X2goClient instance
