 # So, there are two query modes for the X2GO Broker Agent: LOCAL and SSH.

 #
 #            How it works: Assume that the local system has an X2Go Broker Agent
-#            that knows about the multi-server setup. This means: X2Go Server has
-#            to be installed locally and the X2Go Server has to be configured to
-#            use the multi-server farms PostgreSQL session DB backend.
-#
-#            The local system that is running the broker does not necessarily have
-#            to be a real application server. It only has to be aware of running/suspended
-#            sessions within the X2Go multi-server farm setup.
-#
-#            A typical use-case is X2Go on top of a Debian Edu Terminal-Server farm:
-#
-#              TJENER -&gt; PostgreSQL DB, X2Go Server, X2Go Session Broker + Broker Agent
-#              TS01 - TS0X -&gt; X2Go Server configured to use the PostgreSQL DB on TJENER
-#
-#    SSH   - The more generic approach, but also more complex. It allows that the broker
-#            on this system may serve for many different X2Go Server multi-server setups.
-#
-#            With the SSH agent query mode, the X2Go Session Broker will query one of the X2Go
-#            Servers in the targeted multi-server setup (through SSH). The SSH authentication
-#            is done by a system user account (normally UID=x2gobroker) and SSH pub/priv
-#            key authentication has to be configured to make this work.
-#
-#            All X2Go Servers in a multi-server farm need the X2Go Broker Agent installed,
-#            whereas this local system running the X2Go Session Broker does not need a
