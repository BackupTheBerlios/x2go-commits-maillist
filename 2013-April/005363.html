- ===== X2Go related code projects that could be submitted to GSOC 2013 =====
+ ====== New features for X2Go ======
  
- Below you find a list of code projects that we (X2Go upstream) are interested in. Most of the projects we have on our todo lists, anyway, but there are always other things that sneak in as more important. Getting help by some genuine people on the code projects listed below would be really awesome.
+ Below you find a list of new code projects that we are interested in, but
noone has started working on them, yet. 
  
- However, if you do not sense affinity to any of the project ideas listed below, feel free to propose your own code project idea.
+ ===== X2Go Client =====
  
  ==== X2Go Client / X2Go Plugin on Chromebooks ====
    * As [[<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromebook|Chromebooks">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromebook|Chromebooks</A>]] are a kind &quot;Thin Client&quot; &quot;look-alikes&quot;, it would be a good idea to be able to access Linux machines via X2Go.
    * As it is only possible to install applications on chromeOS (running on an original chromebook) via the [[<A HREF="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/home|Googles">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/home|Googles</A> webstore]] of Google Chrome, X2Go Client needs to packaged for [[<A HREF="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/home|Googles">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/home|Googles</A> webstore]]. Preferences and maybe session files should be altered and committed, so that users can sync them with their Google account.
+ 
+ ===== X2Go Server ======
  
  ==== Access X2Go Server Sessions via HTML5 Client ====
    * It's difficult for the X2Go Project to offer
clients on a number of mobile devices lacking an X.Org server and with rules that make it very difficult to submit GPL'ed software to their ecosystems.
    * An HTML5 Client could help to build native apps and render sessions on a [[<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element|HTML5">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element|HTML5</A> Canvas]]
    * In the first step, it would be possible to use existing vnc&lt;-&gt;canvas proxies like [[<A HREF="http://kanaka.github.com/noVNC/|noVNC">http://kanaka.github.com/noVNC/|noVNC</A>]] or [[<A HREF="http://guac-dev.org/|Guacamole">http://guac-dev.org/|Guacamole</A>]].
+ 
+ ===== NX-Libs =====
  
  ==== Upgrade GLX extension in NX (redistributed) ====
    * With Ubuntu 12.10, Canonical has dropped Unity-2d support
    * Starting with Ubuntu 12.10, Unity requires a modern Xserver with GLX v8 included
    * The weakness of X2Go definitely is the NX Xserver used for display server session on the client
    * This coding project would be a start to gradually update the Xserver extensions shipped with NX
    * During this project you will get a deep insight into Xserver code. You need good C and
Cplusplus skills to start this code project. You have to be a magician with C coding debugging tools!!!
+ 
+ ===== Desktop Bindings =====
  
  ==== X2Go Desktop Applet ====
    * Status quo: for several desktop the X2Go project offers a desktop integration (=binding) package
    * One that can be used as a template and reference is the package: plasma-widget-x2go. It provides a Plasma widget that can dock into KDE4's panel and this widget then gives you control over your X2Go session
    * Unfortunately, the Plasma X2Go widget is for KDE4 only and of no use to users GNOME, Unity, XFCE, etc.
    * The idea: create a desktop independent applet that docks into the systems systray (or into the appindicator area). This applet then gives you control over your X2Go session from inside the X2Go session: unmount client-side folder, manage print job, suspend X2Go session, grant permission for desktop sharing, etc.
    * Please use the tools ''plasma-widget-x2go'' and ''x2godesktopsharing'' as
reference and as a start point
    * Implementation shall be in C++ using Qt4.
+ 
+ ===== X2Go Session Broker ======
  
  ==== X2Go Session Broker WebGUI Service ====
  
    * Similar to Canonical's [[<A HREF="https://uccs.landscape.canonical.com/|UCCS">https://uccs.landscape.canonical.com/|UCCS</A> Service]] X2Go admins may want to provide a company-wide site where users of the infrastructure shall be able to configure their favourite (X2Go, RDP) servers in the company's network
@@ -43,8 +51,10 @@
    * To make the client&lt;-&gt;broker communication more robust, this shall be changed to X2Go Client
    * However, transparent backward compatibility must be granted at the same time: new X2Go Clients must continue to be able to speak the older broker protocol, new X2Go Session Brokers must be able to understand old X2Go Clients
    * Good knowledge of Qt4 and Cplusplus are required for this task
  
+ 
+ ===== PyHoca / Python X2Go =====
     
  ==== PyHoca-PubAppDaemon - transparent X2Go Published Applications Integration into local Desktops ====

 
    * This idea focuses on X2Go integration into Unity desktops (for providing hybrid fat/thin clients)
