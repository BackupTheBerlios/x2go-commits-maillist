  While the system isn't limited to a particular hardware configuration (we've shipped regular midi-tower cases as well as 19&quot;, 1HU rack-mount servers), our standard model is a fanless (i.e. entirely passively cooled), very compact case with enough CPU and RAM for up to 5 concurrent users. A picture, showing the box on top of a stack of copy paper for easy size comparison, is available here: [[<A HREF="http://www.baur-itcs.de/20-servermodelle/10-lexcomputechtwister/">http://www.baur-itcs.de/20-servermodelle/10-lexcomputechtwister/</A>]]
  
 
This allows us to offer an affordable solution even for small offices like a general practicioner's office.

+ Obviously, there is a high demand for data protection solutions in the healthcare sector (as probably everyone can understand immediately), and this is where we've sold quite a number of Electronic GloveBoxes so far. Of course, it could also be used by lawyers, product designers (think industrial espionage), and similar professions where you just don't want to see your confidential data leaked onto the Internet.
  
- For usability reasons, we're using the X2Go Published Applications feature of the X2Go Client for providing the applications to the user - in fact, we're the ones who [[doc:sponsors|sponsored]] the development of said feature.
+ To provide a good user experience, we're using the X2Go Published Applications feature of the
X2Go Client for providing the applications to the user - in fact, we're the ones who [[doc:sponsors|sponsored]] the development of said feature.
  
  What we're publishing is a minimal set of internet applications (browser, mail client, PDF Viewer and Open Office), accessible via right-click on the X2Go icon in the taskbar. 
+ 
+ Thanks to the Published Application Mode, these applications interact with the Desktop as if they were installed locally on the machine, there is no annoying full-desktop window that you need to drag out of the way to access your local applications, like you might know it from using VNC or RDP. 
  
  Please visit our website for further information and to view a screencast. The website is in German only at the moment, but if you are interested in selling GloveBoxes in your country, feel free to contact us by e-Mail and we'll provide you with English translations of whatever you may need. Also, while the screencast has German on-screen text and no translation
yet, it should be rather easy to figure out what it's about, even without unerstanding the language.
