  It places a Terminal Server (in our case, a Linux box running X2Go) in a demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Firewalls. This Terminal Server may freely surf the net, but it cannot initiate &quot;downstream&quot; connections towards the LAN. From the LAN side, it is possible to connect to the Terminal Server (in our case, via SSH), but direct outbound connections to the Internet are blocked by default.
  
  Where we're diverting from the standard ReCoBS approach is that we're using a single
firewall with a third ethernet port for the DMZ, and we're running both the firewall and the X2Go Terminal Server as virtual machines on a stripped down Debian Linux with KVM.
  
- While the system isn't limited to a particular hardware configuration (we've shipped regular midi-tower cases as well as 19&quot;, 1HU rack-mount servers), our standard model is a fanless (i.e. entirely passively cooled), very compact case with enough CPU and RAM for up to 5 concurrent users.

  This allows us to offer an affordable solution even for
small offices like a general practicioner's office.
  
  Obviously, there is a high demand for data protection solutions in the healthcare sector (as probably everyone can understand immediately).
