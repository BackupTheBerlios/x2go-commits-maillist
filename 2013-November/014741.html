Edit Summary:

  It places a terminal server (in our case, a Linux box running X2Go) in a demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two firewalls. This terminal server may freely surf the net, but it cannot initiate &quot;downstream&quot; connections towards the LAN. From the LAN side, it is possible to connect &quot;upstream&quot; to the terminal server (in our case, via X2Go/SSH), but direct outbound connections to the Internet are blocked by default.
  
  Where we're diverting from the standard ReCoBS
approach is that we're using a single firewall with a third ethernet port for the DMZ, and we're running both the firewall and the X2Go terminal server as virtual machines on a stripped down Debian Linux with KVM. Also, we're providing a web proxy server with a default deny policy, so that you can whitelist &quot;safe&quot; domains like microsoft and antivirus updates, or online banking portals, and access those using your locally installed browser or online banking software (which makes more sense from a security standpoint, if you think about it).
  
- While the system isn't limited to a particular hardware configuration (we've shipped regular midi-tower cases as well as 19&quot;, 1HU rack-mount servers), our standard model is a fanless (i.e. entirely passively cooled), very compact case with enough CPU and RAM for up to 5 concurrent users. A picture, showing the box on top of a stack of copy paper for easy size comparison, is available here:

  This allows us to offer an affordable solution even for small offices like a general practicioner's office.
  
  Obviously, there is a high demand for data protection solutions in the healthcare sector (as probably everyone can understand immediately), and this is where we've sold quite a number of Electronic GloveBoxes so far. Of course, it could also be used by lawyers, product designers (think industrial espionage), and similar professions where you just
don't want to see your customer records/confidential data leaked onto the Internet.
