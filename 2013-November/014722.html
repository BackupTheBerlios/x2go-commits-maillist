- The Electronic Glovebox is a firewall system targetting at connecting a general practitioner's office to the internet without endangering the intranet machines. There is a high demand in
medical contexts concerning data protection (as probably everyone can understand immediately).
+ The Electronic Glovebox is our implementation of a ''Re''mote ''Co''ntrolled ''B''rowsers ''S''ystem, ReCoBS.
  
- The Electronic Glovebox combines a firewall system with a secluded X2Go Server inside. The X2Go Server on the Glovebox provides a minimal set of internet applications (browser, mail client, PDF Viewer and Open Office). Whereas internet access for intranet machines is completely blocked, the intranet machines can connect to an X2Go session on the Glovebox and this X2Go server than provides internet functionality.
+ ReCoBS is a security concept designed by the German Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt f&#252;r Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, BSI).
  
- X2Go Client uses the X2Go Published Applications feature for providing the applications to the user.
+ It places a Terminal Server (in our case, a Linux box running X2Go) in a demilitarized zone (DMZ) between
two Firewalls. This Terminal Server may freely surf the net, but it cannot initiate &quot;downstream&quot; connections towards the LAN. From the LAN side, it is possible to connect to the Terminal Server (in our case, via SSH), but direct outbound connections to the Internet are blocked by default.
  
- Please visit my site for further information and to view a screencast. Everything is in German only at the moment.
+ Where we're diverting from the standard ReCoBS approach is that we're using a single firewall with a third ethernet port for the DMZ, and we're running both the firewall and the X2Go Terminal Server as virtual machines on a stripped down Debian Linux with KVM.

+ While the system isn't limited to a particular hardware configuration (we've shipped regular midi-tower cases as well as 19&quot;, 1HU rack-mount servers), our standard model is a
fanless (i.e. entirely passively cooled), very compact case with enough CPU and RAM for up to 5 concurrent users.
  
+ This allows us to offer an affordable solution even for small offices like a general practicioner's office.
  
+ Obviously, there is a high demand for data protection solutions in the healthcare sector (as probably everyone can understand immediately).
+ 
+ For usability reasons, we're using the X2Go Published Applications feature of the X2Go Client for providing the applications to the user - in fact, we're the ones who [[doc:sponsors|sponsored]] the development of said feature.
+ 
+ What we're publishing is a minimal set of internet applications (browser, mail client, PDF Viewer and Open Office), accessible via right-click on the X2Go icon in the taskbar. 
+ 
+ Please visit our website for further information and to view a screencast. The website is in German only at the moment, but if you are interested in selling GloveBoxes in your country, feel free to contact
us by e-Mail and we'll provide you with English translations of whatever you may need. Also, while the screencast has German on-screen text and no translation yet, it should be rather easy to figure out what it's about, even without unerstanding the language.
