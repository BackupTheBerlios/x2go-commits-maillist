+===========================================================
+
+djgpp2/coff
+-----------
+ * all overlays (except Allegro pakfiles) are silently stripped
+
+dos/exe
+-------
+ * normal dos/exes with new exe headers
+ * max ~24000 relocation records (...should be enough for everyone ;-)
+ * exe + sys combined images
+
+watcom/le
+---------
+ * 16-bit selector alias fixups

+ * 16:16 fixups
+
+If you need any of the above (they're very rare), send us an URL of a
+test file.
+
+ * 16-bit objects are not loaded into DOS memory
+ * There is still a problem with the wdosx extender: if you compress a
+   watcom/le file which does NOT contain the wdosx extender, and after this
+   you bind the wdosx stub to the compressed file, then it will work.
+   Otherwise it won't.
+ * unpacked pmwlite compressed programs might not work when compressed
+   with UPX (this is a bug in pmwunlite)
+
+win32/pe
+--------
+ * writable shared sections (`--force' *may* work)
+ * certificates in the image

+                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+                       Version 2, June 1991
+
+ Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
+ 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+                            Preamble
+
+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
+software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
+General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
+Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
+using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
+the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
+your programs, too.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
+distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
+gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
+you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
+source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
+rights.
+
+  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
+distribute and/or modify the software.
+
+  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
+software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
+authors' reputations.
+
+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
+program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
+program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
+patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.
+
+                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
+a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
+under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
+refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
+either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
+language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
+the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
+
+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
+is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
+Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
+Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
+
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
+source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
+conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
+copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
+notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
+and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
+along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
+    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
+    parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
+    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
+    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
+    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
+    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
+    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
+    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Program.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
+    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
+    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
+    customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
+    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
+    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
+    received the program in object code or executable form with such
+    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
+
+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
+special exception, the source code distributed need not include
+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
+parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
+any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
+apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
+circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
+may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
+those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
+countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
+the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
+
+  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
+of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
+address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
+later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
+either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
+Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
+this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
+Foundation.
+
+  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
+to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
+Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
+make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
+of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
+of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
+
+                            NO WARRANTY
+
+  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
+FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
+OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
+PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
+OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
+MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
+TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
+PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
+REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
+WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
+REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
+INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
+OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
+TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
+YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
+PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
+    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+    GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
+    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
+    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
+when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
+be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
+  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

+

+SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR COMPRESSED EXECUTABLES
+============================================
+
+   The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part
+   of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The
+   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing
+   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.
+
+   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special
+   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs
+   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:
+
+   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX
+      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)
+      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as
+      distributed by us.
+   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.
+      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical
+      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.
+   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get
+      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at
+      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,
+      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.
+
+
+ANNOTATIONS
+===========
+
+  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for
+    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.
+
+  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX
+    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,
+    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your
+    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to
+    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.
+
+  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use
+    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we
+    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects
+    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -
+    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious
+    by definition.
+
+  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that
+    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant
+    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.
+
+  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and
+    similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to
+    incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.

+
+Changes in 3.04 (27 Sep 2009):
+  * new format Mach/AMD64 supports 64-bit programs on Apple Macintosh.
+  * new formats Dylib/i386 and Dylib/ppc32 support shared libraries

+    Universal binaries [i686 and PowerPC only]
+  * dos/exe: LZMA is now also supported for 16-bit dos/exe. Please note that
+    you have to explicitly use '--lzma' even for '--ultra-brute' here

+WELCOME
+=======
+
+Welcome to UPX !
+
+Please don't forget to read the file LICENSE - UPX is distributed
+under the GNU General Public License (GPL) with special exceptions
+allowing the distribution of all compressed executables, including
+commercial programs.
+
+
+INTRODUCTION
+============
+
+UPX is an advanced executable file compressor. UPX will typically
+reduce the file size of programs and DLLs by around 50%-70%, thus
+reducing disk space, network load times, download times and
+other distribution and storage costs.
+
+Programs and libraries compressed by UPX are completely self-contained
+and run exactly as before, with no runtime or memory penalty for most
+of the supported formats.
+
+UPX supports a number of different executable formats, including
+Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/CE programs and DLLs, DOS programs,
+and Linux executables and kernels.
+
+UPX is free software distributed under the term of the GNU General
+Public License. Full source code is available.
+
+UPX may be distributed and used freely, even with commercial applications.
+See the UPX License Agreement for details.
+
+UPX is rated number one in the well known Archive Comparison Test. Visit
+<A HREF="http://compression.ca/">http://compression.ca/</A> .
+
+UPX aims to be Commercial Quality Freeware.
+
+
+SHORT DOCUMENTATION
+===================
+
+'upx program.exe' will compress a program or DLL. For best compression
+results try 'upx --brute program.exe'.
+
+Please see the file UPX.DOC for the full documentation. The files
+NEWS and BUGS also contain various tidbits of information.
+
+
+DISCLAIMER
+==========
+
+UPX comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details see the file LICENSE.
+
+Having said that, we think that UPX is quite stable now. Indeed we
+have compressed lots of files without any problems. Also, the
+current version has undergone several months of beta testing -
+actually it's almost 8 years since our first public beta.
+
+This is the first production quality release, and we plan that future
+releases will be backward compatible with this version.
+
+Please report all problems or suggestions to the authors. Thanks.
+
+
+THE FUTURE
+==========
+
+  - We'd really love to support handheld systems like the PalmPilot because
+    compression makes a lot of sense here. And - because of the atari/tos
+    format - we already have a working decompressor in 68000 assembly.
+    Unfortunately we know next to nothing about the operating system
+    architecture of such handhelds, so we need some information from
+    an expert. Please contact us if you think you can help.
+
+  - The Linux approach could probably get ported to a lot of other Unix
+    variants, at least for other i386 architectures it shouldn't be too
+    much work. If someone sends me a fresh hard disk and an official
+    FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD/Solaris/BeOS... CD I might take a look at it ;-)
+
+  - We will *NOT* add any sort of protection and/or encryption.
+    This only gives people a false feeling of security because
+    by definition all protectors/compressors can be broken.
+    And don't trust any advertisement of authors of other executable
+    compressors about this topic - just do a websearch on &quot;unpackers&quot;...
+
+  - Fix all remaining bugs - keep your reports coming ;-)
+
+  - See the file PROJECTS in the source code distribution if you want
+    to contribute.

+UPX TODO list. Last updated 2006-12-08.
+
+
+IMPORTANT PROBLEMS THAT SHOULD BE FIXED SOON:
+
+- [None]
+
+
+OTHER:
+
+- docs: convert docs from upx.pod to use AsciiDoc
+
+- check all &lt;const_cast&gt; to make sure they are not invalid
+
+- throwNotCompressible() is not a real error, so make the output nicer
+  (info: bla bla). Also ui.cpp (total_*).
+
+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+
+IMPROVED COMPRESSION RATIO
+==========================
+
+- experiment with new filters
+
+- implement filters for dos/exe
+
+- filters: could we exploit a f-&gt;firstcall info field ?
+
+- for small programs (e.g. &lt; 64k), try an additional algorithm
+  to see if it gives better compression
+
+
+ALL FORMATS
+===========
+
+- more thoroughly test the exe-header in canPack()
+  and throw exceptions when encountering bad values.
+
+- implement `--cpu=486' option to use bswap on the 32-bit formats
+    (if cpu &gt;= 486)
+
+
+FORMAT DJGPP2/COFF
+==================
+
+- handle overlays
+
+- fix default file extension handling when the --coff option is set
+
+
+FORMAT DOS/EXE
+==============
+
+- implement filters
+
+- add a check so that we don't pack djgpp1 binaries
+
+
+FORMAT LINUX/386
+================
+
+- don't mmap() the temporary output file - this seems to improve
+    file io speed
+
+
+FORMAT TMT/ADAM
+===============
+
+- the decompressors are already aligned, no need for an
+    extra alignment
+
+
+FORMAT WATCOM/LE
+================
+
+- handle files without relocations
+
+- the decompressors are already aligned, no need for an
+    extra alignment
+
+- fix default file extension handling when the --le option is set
+
+- handle holes in the file
+
+
+FORMAT WIN16/NE
+===============
+
+- implement readFileHeader() to correctly identify a win16/ne
+  executable, so that the call for contribution will get thrown
+
+
+FORMAT WIN32/PE
+===============
+
+- fix the section alignment with the Intel compiler
+
+- decrease runtime memory overhead
+
+3 - difficult) don't compress the BSS section and other holes.
+
+4 - medium - ml) fix when objectalign &lt; 0x1000
+
+4 - easy - ml) put the original offset of moved resources somewhere into
+    the res.dir. (if it's safe to do)
+
+4 - ??? - ml) fix FIXMEs
+
+5 - medium - ml) try to put the preprocessed imports &amp; relocs back to their
+    original section if possible. this could save some virtual memory
+    address space.

+.SH &quot;DESCRIPTION&quot;
+.IX Header &quot;DESCRIPTION&quot;
+\&amp;\fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR is a versatile executable packer with the following features:
+.PP
+.Vb 2
+\&amp;  \- excellent compression ratio: compresses better than zip/gzip,
+\&amp;      use UPX to decrease the size of your distribution !
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- very fast decompression: about 10 MiB/sec on an ancient Pentium 133,
+\&amp;      about 200 MiB/sec on an Athlon XP 2000+.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- no memory overhead for your compressed executables for most of the
+\&amp;      supported formats
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- safe: you can list, test and unpack your executables
+\&amp;      Also, a checksum of both the compressed and uncompressed file is
+\&amp;      maintained internally.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- universal: UPX can pack a number of executable formats:
+\&amp;      * atari/tos
+\&amp;      * bvmlinuz/386    [bootable Linux kernel]
+\&amp;      * djgpp2/coff
+\&amp;      * dos/com
+\&amp;      * dos/exe
+\&amp;      * dos/sys
+\&amp;      * linux/386
+\&amp;      * linux/elf386
+\&amp;      * linux/sh386
+\&amp;      * ps1/exe
+\&amp;      * rtm32/pe
+\&amp;      * tmt/adam
+\&amp;      * vmlinuz/386     [bootable Linux kernel]
+\&amp;      * vmlinux/386
+\&amp;      * watcom/le (supporting DOS4G, PMODE/W, DOS32a and CauseWay)
+\&amp;      * win32/pe (exe and dll)
+\&amp;      * arm/pe (exe and dll)
+\&amp;      * linux/elfamd64
+\&amp;      * linux/elfppc32
+\&amp;      * mach/elfppc32
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- portable: UPX is written in portable endian\-neutral C++
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- extendable: because of the class layout it\*(Aqs very easy to support
+\&amp;      new executable formats or add new compression algorithms
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- free: UPX can be distributed and used freely. And from version 0.99
+\&amp;      the full source code of UPX is released under the GNU General Public
+\&amp;      License (GPL) !

+.PP
+You probably understand now why we call \fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR the &quot;\fIultimate\fR&quot;
+executable packer.
+.SH &quot;COMMANDS&quot;
+.IX Header &quot;COMMANDS&quot;
+.SS &quot;Compress&quot;
+.IX Subsection &quot;Compress&quot;
+This is the default operation, eg. \fBupx yourfile.exe\fR will compress the file
+specified on the command line.
+.SS &quot;Decompress&quot;
+.IX Subsection &quot;Decompress&quot;
+All \fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR supported file formats can be unpacked using the \fB\-d\fR switch, eg.
+\&amp;\fBupx \-d yourfile.exe\fR will uncompress the file you've just compressed.
+.SS &quot;Test&quot;
+.IX Subsection &quot;Test&quot;
+The \fB\-t\fR command tests the integrity of the compressed and uncompressed
+data, eg. \fBupx \-t yourfile.exe\fR check whether your file can be safely
+decompressed. Note, that this command doesn't check the whole file, only
+the part that will be uncompressed during program execution. This means
+that you should not use this command instead of a virus checker.
+.SS &quot;List&quot;
+.IX Subsection &quot;List&quot;
+The \fB\-l\fR command prints out some information about the compressed files
+specified on the command line as parameters, eg \fBupx \-l yourfile.exe\fR
+shows the compressed / uncompressed size and the compression ratio of
+\&amp;\fIyourfile.exe\fR.
+.SH &quot;OPTIONS&quot;
+.IX Header &quot;OPTIONS&quot;
+\&amp;\fB\-q\fR: be quiet, suppress warnings
+.PP
+\&amp;\fB\-q \-q\fR (or \fB\-qq\fR): be very quiet, suppress errors
+.PP
+\&amp;\fB\-q \-q \-q\fR (or \fB\-qqq\fR): produce no output at all
+.PP
+\&amp;\fB\-\-help\fR: prints the help
+.PP
+\&amp;\fB\-\-version\fR: print the version of \fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR
+.PP
+\&amp;\fB\-\-exact\fR: when compressing, require to be able to get a byte-identical file
+after decompression with option \fB\-d\fR. [\s-1NOTE:\s0 this is work in progress and is
+not supported for all formats yet. If you do care, as a workaround you can
+compress and then decompress your program a first time \- any further
+compress-decompress steps should then yield byte-identical results
+as compared to the first decompressed version.]
+.PP
+[ ...to be written... \- type `\fBupx \-\-help\fR' for now ]
+.SH &quot;COMPRESSION LEVELS &amp; TUNING&quot;
+.IX Header &quot;COMPRESSION LEVELS &amp; TUNING&quot;
+\&amp;\fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR offers ten different compression levels from \fB\-1\fR to \fB\-9\fR,
+and \fB\-\-best\fR.  The default compression level is \fB\-8\fR for files
+smaller than 512 KiB, and \fB\-7\fR otherwise.
+.IP &quot;\(bu&quot; 4
+Compression levels 1, 2 and 3 are pretty fast.
+.IP &quot;\(bu&quot; 4
+Compression levels 4, 5 and 6 achieve a good time/ratio performance.
+.IP &quot;\(bu&quot; 4
+Compression levels 7, 8 and 9 favor compression ratio over speed.
+.IP &quot;\(bu&quot; 4
+Compression level \fB\-\-best\fR may take a long time.
+.PP
+Note that compression level \fB\-\-best\fR can be somewhat slow for large
+files, but you definitely should use it when releasing a final version
+of your program.
+.PP
+Quick info for achieving the best compression ratio:
+.IP &quot;\(bu&quot; 4
+Try \fBupx \-\-brute myfile.exe\fR or even \fBupx \-\-ultra\-brute myfile.exe\fR.
+.IP &quot;\(bu&quot; 4
+Try if \fB\-\-overlay=strip\fR works.
+.IP &quot;\(bu&quot; 4
+For win32/pe programs there's \fB\-\-strip\-relocs=0\fR. See notes below.
+.SH &quot;OVERLAY HANDLING OPTIONS&quot;
+.IX Header &quot;OVERLAY HANDLING OPTIONS&quot;
+Info: An \*(L&quot;overlay\*(R&quot; means auxiliary data attached after the logical end of
+an executable, and it often contains application specific data
+(this is a common practice to avoid an extra data file, though
+it would be better to use resource sections).
+.PP
+\&amp;\fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR handles overlays like many other executable packers do: it simply
+copies the overlay after the compressed image. This works with some
+files, but doesn't work with others, depending on how an application
+actually accesses this overlayed data.
+.PP
+.Vb 1
+\&amp;  \-\-overlay=copy    Copy any extra data attached to the file. [DEFAULT]
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \-\-overlay=strip   Strip any overlay from the program instead of
+\&amp;                    copying it. Be warned, this may make the compressed
+\&amp;                    program crash or otherwise unusable.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \-\-overlay=skip    Refuse to compress any program which has an overlay.
+.Ve
+.SH &quot;ENVIRONMENT&quot;
+.IX Header &quot;ENVIRONMENT&quot;
+The environment variable \fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR can hold a set of default
+options for \fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR. These options are interpreted first and
+can be overwritten by explicit command line parameters.
+For example:
+.PP
+.Vb 3
+\&amp;    for DOS/Windows:   set UPX=\-9 \-\-compress\-icons#0
+\&amp;    for sh/ksh/zsh:    UPX=&quot;\-9 \-\-compress\-icons=0&quot;; export UPX
+\&amp;    for csh/tcsh:      setenv UPX &quot;\-9 \-\-compress\-icons=0&quot;
+.Ve
+.PP
+Under DOS/Windows you must use '#' instead of '=' when setting the
+environment variable because of a \s-1COMMAND\s0.COM limitation.
+.PP
+Not all of the options are valid in the environment variable \-
+\&amp;\fB\s-1UPX\s0\fR will tell you.
+.PP
+You can explicitly use the \fB\-\-no\-env\fR option to ignore the
+environment variable.

+\&amp;  Linux/386 support in UPX consists of 3 different executable formats,
+\&amp;  one optimized for ELF executables (&quot;linux/elf386&quot;), one optimized
+\&amp;  for shell scripts (&quot;linux/sh386&quot;), and one generic format
+\&amp;  (&quot;linux/386&quot;).
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  We will start with a general discussion first, but please
+\&amp;  also read the relevant docs for each of the individual formats.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  Also, there is special support for bootable kernels \- see the
+\&amp;  description of the vmlinuz/386 format.

+General user's overview
+.PP
+.Vb 7
+\&amp;  Running a compressed executable program trades less space on a
+\&amp;  \`\`permanent\*(Aq\*(Aq storage medium (such as a hard disk, floppy disk,
+\&amp;  CD\-ROM, flash memory, EPROM, etc.) for more space in one or more
+\&amp;  \`\`temporary\*(Aq\*(Aq storage media (such as RAM, swap space, /tmp, etc.).
+\&amp;  Running a compressed executable also requires some additional CPU
+\&amp;  cycles to generate the compressed executable in the first place,
+\&amp;  and to decompress it at each invocation.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  How much space is traded?  It depends on the executable, but many
+\&amp;  programs save 30% to 50% of permanent disk space.  How much CPU
+\&amp;  overhead is there?  Again, it depends on the executable, but
+\&amp;  decompression speed generally is at least many megabytes per second,
+\&amp;  and frequently is limited by the speed of the underlying disk
+\&amp;  or network I/O.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  Depending on the statistics of usage and access, and the relative
+\&amp;  speeds of CPU, RAM, swap space, /tmp, and file system storage, then
+\&amp;  invoking and running a compressed executable can be faster than
+\&amp;  directly running the corresponding uncompressed program.
+\&amp;  The operating system might perform fewer expensive I/O operations
+\&amp;  to invoke the compressed program.  Paging to or from swap space
+\&amp;  or /tmp might be faster than paging from the general file system.
+\&amp;  \`\`Medium\-sized\*(Aq\*(Aq programs which access about 1/3 to 1/2 of their
+\&amp;  stored program bytes can do particularly well with compression.
+\&amp;  Small programs tend not to benefit as much because the absolute
+\&amp;  savings is less.  Big programs tend not to benefit proportionally
+\&amp;  because each invocation may use only a small fraction of the program,
+\&amp;  yet UPX decompresses the entire program before invoking it.
+\&amp;  But in environments where disk or flash memory storage is limited,
+\&amp;  then compression may win anyway.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  Currently, executables compressed by UPX do not share RAM at runtime
+\&amp;  in the way that executables mapped from a file system do.  As a
+\&amp;  result, if the same program is run simultaneously by more than one
+\&amp;  process, then using the compressed version will require more RAM and/or
+\&amp;  swap space.  So, shell programs (bash, csh, etc.)  and \`\`make\*(Aq\*(Aq
+\&amp;  might not be good candidates for compression.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  UPX recognizes three executable formats for Linux: Linux/elf386,
+\&amp;  Linux/sh386, and Linux/386.  Linux/386 is the most generic format;
+\&amp;  it accommodates any file that can be executed.  At runtime, the UPX
+\&amp;  decompression stub re\-creates in /tmp a copy of the original file,
+\&amp;  and then the copy is (re\-)executed with the same arguments.
+\&amp;  ELF binary executables prefer the Linux/elf386 format by default,
+\&amp;  because UPX decompresses them directly into RAM, uses only one
+\&amp;  exec, does not use space in /tmp, and does not use /proc.
+\&amp;  Shell scripts where the underlying shell accepts a \`\`\-c\*(Aq\*(Aq argument
+\&amp;  can use the Linux/sh386 format.  UPX decompresses the shell script
+\&amp;  into low memory, then maps the shell and passes the entire text of the
+\&amp;  script as an argument with a leading \`\`\-c\*(Aq\*(Aq.
+.Ve
+.PP
+General benefits:
+.PP
+.Vb 4
+\&amp;  \- UPX can compress all executables, be it AOUT, ELF, libc4, libc5,
+\&amp;    libc6, Shell/Perl/Python/... scripts, standalone Java .class
+\&amp;    binaries, or whatever...
+\&amp;    All scripts and programs will work just as before.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- Compressed programs are completely self\-contained. No need for
+\&amp;    any external program.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- UPX keeps your original program untouched. This means that
+\&amp;    after decompression you will have a byte\-identical version,
+\&amp;    and you can use UPX as a file compressor just like gzip.
+\&amp;    [ Note that UPX maintains a checksum of the file internally,
+\&amp;      so it is indeed a reliable alternative. ]
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- As the stub only uses syscalls and isn\*(Aqt linked against libc it
+\&amp;    should run under any Linux configuration that can run ELF
+\&amp;    binaries.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- For the same reason compressed executables should run under
+\&amp;    FreeBSD and other systems which can run Linux binaries.
+\&amp;    [ Please send feedback on this topic ]
+.Ve
+.PP
+General drawbacks:
+.PP
+.Vb 4
+\&amp;  \- It is not advisable to compress programs which usually have many
+\&amp;    instances running (like \`sh\*(Aq or \`make\*(Aq) because the common segments of
+\&amp;    compressed programs won\*(Aqt be shared any longer between different
+\&amp;    processes.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- \`ldd\*(Aq and \`size\*(Aq won\*(Aqt show anything useful because all they
+\&amp;    see is the statically linked stub.  Since version 0.82 the section
+\&amp;    headers are stripped from the UPX stub and \`size\*(Aq doesn\*(Aqt even
+\&amp;    recognize the file format.  The file patches/patch\-elfcode.h has a
+\&amp;    patch to fix this bug in \`size\*(Aq and other programs which use GNU BFD.
+.Ve
+.PP
+General notes:
+.PP
+.Vb 2
+\&amp;  \- As UPX leaves your original program untouched it is advantageous
+\&amp;    to strip it before compression.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- If you compress a script you will lose platform independence \-
+\&amp;    this could be a problem if you are using NFS mounted disks.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- Compression of suid, guid and sticky\-bit programs is rejected
+\&amp;    because of possible security implications.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- For the same reason there is no sense in making any compressed
+\&amp;    program suid.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- Obviously UPX won\*(Aqt work with executables that want to read data
+\&amp;    from themselves. E.g., this might be a problem for Perl scripts
+\&amp;    which access their _\|_DATA_\|_ lines.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- In case of internal errors the stub will abort with exitcode 127.
+\&amp;    Typical reasons for this to happen are that the program has somehow
+\&amp;    been modified after compression.
+\&amp;    Running \`strace \-o strace.log compressed_file\*(Aq will tell you more.

+The generic linux/386 format decompresses to /tmp and needs
+/proc file system support. It starts the decompressed program

+.PP
+How it works:
+.PP
+.Vb 7
+\&amp;  For files which are not ELF and not a script for a known &quot;\-c&quot; shell,
+\&amp;  UPX uses kernel execve(), which first requires decompressing to a
+\&amp;  temporary file in the file system.  Interestingly \-
+\&amp;  because of the good memory management of the Linux kernel \- this
+\&amp;  often does not introduce a noticeable delay, and in fact there
+\&amp;  will be no disk access at all if you have enough free memory as
+\&amp;  the entire process takes places within the file system buffers.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  A compressed executable consists of the UPX stub and an overlay
+\&amp;  which contains the original program in a compressed form.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  The UPX stub is a statically linked ELF executable and does
+\&amp;  the following at program startup:
+\&amp;
+\&amp;    1) decompress the overlay to a temporary location in /tmp
+\&amp;    2) open the temporary file for reading
+\&amp;    3) try to delete the temporary file and start (execve)
+\&amp;       the uncompressed program in /tmp using /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/fd/X as
+\&amp;       attained by step 2)
+\&amp;    4) if that fails, fork off a subprocess to clean up and
+\&amp;       start the program in /tmp in the meantime
+\&amp;

+\&amp;  and only uses kernel syscalls. It is not linked against any libc.
+.Ve

+Specific drawbacks:
+.PP
+.Vb 4
+\&amp;  \- You need additional free disk space for the uncompressed program
+\&amp;    in your /tmp directory. This program is deleted immediately after
+\&amp;    decompression, but you still need it for the full execution time
+\&amp;    of the program.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- You must have /proc file system support as the stub wants to open
+\&amp;    /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/exe and needs /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/fd/X. This also means that you
+\&amp;    cannot compress programs that are used during the boot sequence
+\&amp;    before /proc is mounted.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- Utilities like \`top\*(Aq will display numerical values in the process
+\&amp;    name field. This is because Linux computes the process name from
+\&amp;    the first argument of the last execve syscall (which is typically
+\&amp;    something like /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/fd/3).
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \- Because of temporary decompression to disk the decompression speed
+\&amp;    is not as fast as with the other executable formats. Still, I can see

+\&amp;                      A list member has the following format: I&lt;type[/name]&gt;.
+\&amp;                      I&lt;Type&gt; is the type of the resource. Standard types
+\&amp;                      must be specified as decimal numbers, user types can be
+\&amp;                      specified by decimal IDs or strings. I&lt;Name&gt; is the
+\&amp;                      identifier of the resource. It can be a decimal number
+\&amp;                      or a string. For example:
+\&amp;
+\&amp;                      \-\-keep\-resource=2/MYBITMAP,5,6/12345
+\&amp;
+\&amp;                      UPX won\*(Aqt compress the named bitmap resource &quot;MYBITMAP&quot;,
+\&amp;                      it leaves every dialog (5) resource uncompressed, and
+\&amp;                      it won\*(Aqt touch the string table resource with identifier
+\&amp;                      12345.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \-\-force             Force compression even when there is an
+\&amp;                      unexpected value in a header field.
+\&amp;                      Use with care.
+\&amp;
+\&amp;  \-\-strip\-relocs=0    Don\*(Aqt strip relocation records.
+\&amp;  \-\-strip\-relocs=1    Strip relocation records. [DEFAULT]
+\&amp;                      This option only works on executables with base
+\&amp;                      address greater or equal to 0x400000. Usually the
+\&amp;                      compressed files becomes smaller, but some files
+\&amp;                      may become larger. Note that the resulting file will
+\&amp;                      not work under Windows 3.x (Win32s).
+\&amp;                      UPX never strips relocations from a DLL
+\&amp;                      regardless of this option.

+\&amp;                      the default method gives the best results anyway.

+
+    UPX is a portable, extendable, high-performance executable packer for
+    several different executable formats. It achieves an excellent
+    compression ratio and offers **very** fast decompression. Your
+    executables suffer no memory overhead or other drawbacks for most of the
+    formats supported, because of in-place decompression.
+
+    While you may use UPX freely for both non-commercial and commercial
+    executables (for details see the file LICENSE), we would highly
+    appreciate if you credit UPX and ourselves in the documentation,
+    possibly including a reference to the UPX home page. Thanks.
+
+    [ Using UPX in non-OpenSource applications without proper credits is
+    considered not politically correct ;-) ]
+
+DISCLAIMER
+    UPX comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details see the file LICENSE.
+
+    This is the first production quality release, and we plan that future
+    1.xx releases will be backward compatible with this version.
+
+    Please report all problems or suggestions to the authors. Thanks.
+
+DESCRIPTION
+    UPX is a versatile executable packer with the following features:
+
+      - excellent compression ratio: compresses better than zip/gzip,
+          use UPX to decrease the size of your distribution !
+
+      - very fast decompression: about 10 MiB/sec on an ancient Pentium 133,
+          about 200 MiB/sec on an Athlon XP 2000+.
+
+      - no memory overhead for your compressed executables for most of the
+          supported formats
+
+      - safe: you can list, test and unpack your executables
+          Also, a checksum of both the compressed and uncompressed file is
+          maintained internally.
+
+      - universal: UPX can pack a number of executable formats:
+          * atari/tos
+          * bvmlinuz/386    [bootable Linux kernel]
+          * djgpp2/coff
+          * dos/com
+          * dos/exe
+          * dos/sys
+          * linux/386
+          * linux/elf386
+          * linux/sh386
+          * ps1/exe
+          * rtm32/pe
+          * tmt/adam
+          * vmlinuz/386     [bootable Linux kernel]
+          * vmlinux/386
+          * watcom/le (supporting DOS4G, PMODE/W, DOS32a and CauseWay)
+          * win32/pe (exe and dll)
+          * arm/pe (exe and dll)
+          * linux/elfamd64
+          * linux/elfppc32
+          * mach/elfppc32
+
+      - portable: UPX is written in portable endian-neutral C++
+
+      - extendable: because of the class layout it's very easy to support
+          new executable formats or add new compression algorithms
+
+      - free: UPX can be distributed and used freely. And from version 0.99
+          the full source code of UPX is released under the GNU General Public
+          License (GPL) !
+
+    You probably understand now why we call UPX the &quot;*ultimate*&quot; executable
+    packer.
+
+COMMANDS
+  Compress
+    This is the default operation, eg. upx yourfile.exe will compress the
+    file specified on the command line.
+
+  Decompress
+    All UPX supported file formats can be unpacked using the -d switch, eg.
+    upx -d yourfile.exe will uncompress the file you've just compressed.
+
+  Test
+    The -t command tests the integrity of the compressed and uncompressed
+    data, eg. upx -t yourfile.exe check whether your file can be safely
+    decompressed. Note, that this command doesn't check the whole file, only
+    the part that will be uncompressed during program execution. This means
+    that you should not use this command instead of a virus checker.
+
+  List
+    The -l command prints out some information about the compressed files
+    specified on the command line as parameters, eg upx -l yourfile.exe
+    shows the compressed / uncompressed size and the compression ratio of
+    *yourfile.exe*.
+
+OPTIONS
+    -q: be quiet, suppress warnings
+
+    -q -q (or -qq): be very quiet, suppress errors
+
+    -q -q -q (or -qqq): produce no output at all
+
+    --help: prints the help
+
+    --version: print the version of UPX
+
+    --exact: when compressing, require to be able to get a byte-identical
+    file after decompression with option -d. [NOTE: this is work in progress
+    and is not supported for all formats yet. If you do care, as a
+    workaround you can compress and then decompress your program a first
+    time - any further compress-decompress steps should then yield
+    byte-identical results as compared to the first decompressed version.]
+
+    [ ...to be written... - type `upx --help' for now ]
+
+COMPRESSION LEVELS &amp; TUNING
+    UPX offers ten different compression levels from -1 to -9, and --best.
+    The default compression level is -8 for files smaller than 512 KiB, and
+    -7 otherwise.
+
+    *   Compression levels 1, 2 and 3 are pretty fast.
+
+    *   Compression levels 4, 5 and 6 achieve a good time/ratio performance.
+
+    *   Compression levels 7, 8 and 9 favor compression ratio over speed.
+
+    *   Compression level --best may take a long time.
+
+    Note that compression level --best can be somewhat slow for large files,
+    but you definitely should use it when releasing a final version of your
+    program.
+
+    Quick info for achieving the best compression ratio:
+
+    *   Try upx --brute myfile.exe or even upx --ultra-brute myfile.exe.
+
+    *   Try if --overlay=strip works.
+
+    *   For win32/pe programs there's --strip-relocs=0. See notes below.
+
+OVERLAY HANDLING OPTIONS
+    Info: An &quot;overlay&quot; means auxiliary data attached after the logical end
+    of an executable, and it often contains application specific data (this
+    is a common practice to avoid an extra data file, though it would be
+    better to use resource sections).
+
+    UPX handles overlays like many other executable packers do: it simply
+    copies the overlay after the compressed image. This works with some
+    files, but doesn't work with others, depending on how an application
+    actually accesses this overlayed data.
+
+      --overlay=copy    Copy any extra data attached to the file. [DEFAULT]
+
+      --overlay=strip   Strip any overlay from the program instead of
+                        copying it. Be warned, this may make the compressed
+                        program crash or otherwise unusable.
+
+      --overlay=skip    Refuse to compress any program which has an overlay.
+
+ENVIRONMENT
+    The environment variable UPX can hold a set of default options for UPX.
+    These options are interpreted first and can be overwritten by explicit
+    command line parameters. For example:
+
+        for DOS/Windows:   set UPX=-9 --compress-icons#0
+        for sh/ksh/zsh:    UPX=&quot;-9 --compress-icons=0&quot;; export UPX
+        for csh/tcsh:      setenv UPX &quot;-9 --compress-icons=0&quot;
+
+    Under DOS/Windows you must use '#' instead of '=' when setting the
+    environment variable because of a COMMAND.COM limitation.
+
+    Not all of the options are valid in the environment variable - UPX will
+    tell you.
+
+    You can explicitly use the --no-env option to ignore the environment
+    variable.
+
+NOTES FOR THE SUPPORTED EXECUTABLE FORMATS
+  NOTES FOR ATARI/TOS
+    This is the executable format used by the Atari ST/TT, a Motorola 68000
+    based personal computer which was popular in the late '80s. Support of
+    this format is only because of nostalgic feelings of one of the authors
+    and serves no practical purpose :-). See <A HREF="http://www.freemint.de">http://www.freemint.de</A> for more
+    info.
+
+    Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after
+    uncompression. All debug information will be stripped, though.
+
+    Extra options available for this executable format:
+
+      --all-methods       Compress the program several times, using all
+                          available compression methods. This may improve
+                          the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
+                          the default method gives the best results anyway.
+
+  NOTES FOR BVMLINUZ/I386
+    Same as vmlinuz/i386.
+
+  NOTES FOR DOS/COM
+    Obviously UPX won't work with executables that want to read data from
+    themselves (like some commandline utilities that ship with Win95/98/ME).
+
+    Compressed programs only work on a 286+.
+
+    Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after
+    uncompression.
+
+    Maximum uncompressed size: ~65100 bytes.
+
+    Extra options available for this executable format:
+
+      --8086              Create an executable that works on any 8086 CPU.
+
+      --all-methods       Compress the program several times, using all
+                          available compression methods. This may improve
+                          the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
+                          the default method gives the best results anyway.
+
+      --all-filters       Compress the program several times, using all
+                          available preprocessing filters. This may improve
+                          the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
+                          the default filter gives the best results anyway.
+
+  NOTES FOR DOS/EXE
+    dos/exe stands for all &quot;normal&quot; 16-bit DOS executables.
+
+    Obviously UPX won't work with executables that want to read data from
+    themselves (like some command line utilities that ship with
+    Win95/98/ME).
+
+    Compressed programs only work on a 286+.
+
+    Extra options available for this executable format:
+
+      --8086              Create an executable that works on any 8086 CPU.
+
+      --no-reloc          Use no relocation records in the exe header.
+
+      --all-methods       Compress the program several times, using all
+                          available compression methods. This may improve
+                          the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
+                          the default method gives the best results anyway.
+
+  NOTES FOR DOS/SYS
+    Compressed programs only work on a 286+.
+
+    Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after
+    uncompression.
+
+    Maximum uncompressed size: ~65350 bytes.
+
+    Extra options available for this executable format:
+
+      --8086              Create an executable that works on any 8086 CPU.
+
+      --all-methods       Compress the program several times, using all
+                          available compression methods. This may improve
+                          the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
+                          the default method gives the best results anyway.
+
+      --all-filters       Compress the program several times, using all
+                          available preprocessing filters. This may improve
+                          the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
+                          the default filter gives the best results anyway.
+
+  NOTES FOR DJGPP2/COFF
+    First of all, it is recommended to use UPX *instead* of strip. strip has
+    the very bad habit of replacing your stub with its own (outdated)
+    version. Additionally UPX corrects a bug/feature in strip v2.8.x: it
+    will fix the 4 KiB alignment of the stub.
+
+    UPX includes the full functionality of stubify. This means it will
+    automatically stubify your COFF files. Use the option --coff to disable
+    this functionality (see below).
+
+    UPX automatically handles Allegro packfiles.
+
+    The DLM format (a rather exotic shared library extension) is not
+    supported.
+
+    Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after
+    uncompression. All debug information and trailing garbage will be
+    stripped, though.
+
+    Extra options available for this executable format:
+
+      --coff              Produce COFF output instead of EXE. By default
+                          UPX keeps your current stub.
+
+      --all-methods       Compress the program several times, using all
+                          available compression methods. This may improve
+                          the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
+                          the default method gives the best results anyway.
+
+      --all-filters       Compress the program several times, using all
+                          available preprocessing filters. This may improve
+                          the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
+                          the default filter gives the best results anyway.
+
+  NOTES FOR LINUX [general]
+    Introduction
+
+      Linux/386 support in UPX consists of 3 different executable formats,
+      one optimized for ELF executables (&quot;linux/elf386&quot;), one optimized
+      for shell scripts (&quot;linux/sh386&quot;), and one generic format
+      (&quot;linux/386&quot;).
+
+      We will start with a general discussion first, but please
+      also read the relevant docs for each of the individual formats.
+
+      Also, there is special support for bootable kernels - see the
+      description of the vmlinuz/386 format.
+
+    General user's overview
+
+      Running a compressed executable program trades less space on a
+      ``permanent'' storage medium (such as a hard disk, floppy disk,
+      CD-ROM, flash memory, EPROM, etc.) for more space in one or more
+      ``temporary'' storage media (such as RAM, swap space, /tmp, etc.).
+      Running a compressed executable also requires some additional CPU
+      cycles to generate the compressed executable in the first place,
+      and to decompress it at each invocation.
+
+      How much space is traded?  It depends on the executable, but many
+      programs save 30% to 50% of permanent disk space.  How much CPU
+      overhead is there?  Again, it depends on the executable, but
+      decompression speed generally is at least many megabytes per second,
+      and frequently is limited by the speed of the underlying disk
+      or network I/O.
+
+      Depending on the statistics of usage and access, and the relative
+      speeds of CPU, RAM, swap space, /tmp, and file system storage, then
+      invoking and running a compressed executable can be faster than
+      directly running the corresponding uncompressed program.
+      The operating system might perform fewer expensive I/O operations
+      to invoke the compressed program.  Paging to or from swap space
+      or /tmp might be faster than paging from the general file system.
+      ``Medium-sized'' programs which access about 1/3 to 1/2 of their
+      stored program bytes can do particularly well with compression.
+      Small programs tend not to benefit as much because the absolute
+      savings is less.  Big programs tend not to benefit proportionally
+      because each invocation may use only a small fraction of the program,
+      yet UPX decompresses the entire program before invoking it.
+      But in environments where disk or flash memory storage is limited,
+      then compression may win anyway.
+
+      Currently, executables compressed by UPX do not share RAM at runtime
+      in the way that executables mapped from a file system do.  As a
+      result, if the same program is run simultaneously by more than one
+      process, then using the compressed version will require more RAM and/or
+      swap space.  So, shell programs (bash, csh, etc.)  and ``make''
+      might not be good candidates for compression.
+
+      UPX recognizes three executable formats for Linux: Linux/elf386,
+      Linux/sh386, and Linux/386.  Linux/386 is the most generic format;
+      it accommodates any file that can be executed.  At runtime, the UPX
+      decompression stub re-creates in /tmp a copy of the original file,
+      and then the copy is (re-)executed with the same arguments.
+      ELF binary executables prefer the Linux/elf386 format by default,
+      because UPX decompresses them directly into RAM, uses only one
+      exec, does not use space in /tmp, and does not use /proc.
+      Shell scripts where the underlying shell accepts a ``-c'' argument
+      can use the Linux/sh386 format.  UPX decompresses the shell script
+      into low memory, then maps the shell and passes the entire text of the
+      script as an argument with a leading ``-c''.
+
+    General benefits:
+
+      - UPX can compress all executables, be it AOUT, ELF, libc4, libc5,
+        libc6, Shell/Perl/Python/... scripts, standalone Java .class
+        binaries, or whatever...
+        All scripts and programs will work just as before.
+
+      - Compressed programs are completely self-contained. No need for
+        any external program.
+
+      - UPX keeps your original program untouched. This means that
+        after decompression you will have a byte-identical version,
+        and you can use UPX as a file compressor just like gzip.
+        [ Note that UPX maintains a checksum of the file internally,
+          so it is indeed a reliable alternative. ]
+
+      - As the stub only uses syscalls and isn't linked against libc it
+        should run under any Linux configuration that can run ELF
+        binaries.
+
+      - For the same reason compressed executables should run under
+        FreeBSD and other systems which can run Linux binaries.
+        [ Please send feedback on this topic ]
+
+    General drawbacks:
+
+      - It is not advisable to compress programs which usually have many
+        instances running (like `sh' or `make') because the common segments of
+        compressed programs won't be shared any longer between different
+        processes.
+
+      - `ldd' and `size' won't show anything useful because all they
+        see is the statically linked stub.  Since version 0.82 the section
+        headers are stripped from the UPX stub and `size' doesn't even
+        recognize the file format.  The file patches/patch-elfcode.h has a
+        patch to fix this bug in `size' and other programs which use GNU BFD.
+
+    General notes:
+
+      - As UPX leaves your original program untouched it is advantageous
+        to strip it before compression.
+
+      - If you compress a script you will lose platform independence -
+        this could be a problem if you are using NFS mounted disks.
+
+      - Compression of suid, guid and sticky-bit programs is rejected
+        because of possible security implications.
+
+      - For the same reason there is no sense in making any compressed
+        program suid.
+
+      - Obviously UPX won't work with executables that want to read data
+        from themselves. E.g., this might be a problem for Perl scripts
+        which access their __DATA__ lines.
+
+      - In case of internal errors the stub will abort with exitcode 127.
+        Typical reasons for this to happen are that the program has somehow
+        been modified after compression.
+        Running `strace -o strace.log compressed_file' will tell you more.
+
+  NOTES FOR LINUX/ELF386
+    Please read the general Linux description first.
+
+    The linux/elf386 format decompresses directly into RAM, uses only one
+    exec, does not use space in /tmp, and does not use /proc.
+
+    Linux/elf386 is automatically selected for Linux ELF executables.
+
+    Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after
+    uncompression.
+
+    How it works:
+
+      For ELF executables, UPX decompresses directly to memory, simulating
+      the mapping that the operating system kernel uses during exec(),
+      including the PT_INTERP program interpreter (if any).
+      The brk() is set by a special PT_LOAD segment in the compressed
+      executable itself.  UPX then wipes the stack clean except for
+      arguments, environment variables, and Elf_auxv entries (this is
+      required by bugs in the startup code of /lib/ld-linux.so as of
+      May 2000), and transfers control to the program interpreter or
+      the e_entry address of the original executable.
+
+      The UPX stub is about 1700 bytes long, partly written in assembler
+      and only uses kernel syscalls. It is not linked against any libc.
+
+    Specific drawbacks:
+
+      - For linux/elf386 and linux/sh386 formats, you will be relying on
+        RAM and swap space to hold all of the decompressed program during
+        the lifetime of the process.  If you already use most of your swap
+        space, then you may run out.  A system that is &quot;out of memory&quot;
+        can become fragile.  Many programs do not react gracefully when
+        malloc() returns 0.  With newer Linux kernels, the kernel
+        may decide to kill some processes to regain memory, and you
+        may not like the kernel's choice of which to kill.  Running
+        /usr/bin/top is one way to check on the usage of swap space.
+
+    Extra options available for this executable format:
+
+      (none)
+
+  NOTES FOR LINUX/SH386
+    Please read the general Linux description first.
+
+    Shell scripts where the underling shell accepts a ``-c'' argument can
+    use the Linux/sh386 format. UPX decompresses the shell script into low
+    memory, then maps the shell and passes the entire text of the script as
+    an argument with a leading ``-c''. It does not use space in /tmp, and
+    does not use /proc.
+
+    Linux/sh386 is automatically selected for shell scripts that use a known
+    shell.
+
+    Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after
+    uncompression.
+
+    How it works:
+
+      For shell script executables (files beginning with &quot;#!/&quot; or &quot;#! /&quot;)
+      where the shell is known to accept &quot;-c &lt;command&gt;&quot;, UPX decompresses
+      the file into low memory, then maps the shell (and its PT_INTERP),
+      and passes control to the shell with the entire decompressed file
+      as the argument after &quot;-c&quot;.  Known shells are sh, ash, bash, bsh, csh,
+      ksh, tcsh, pdksh.  Restriction: UPX cannot use this method
+      for shell scripts which use the one optional string argument after
+      the shell name in the script (example: &quot;#! /bin/sh option3\n&quot;.)
+
+      The UPX stub is about 1700 bytes long, partly written in assembler
+      and only uses kernel syscalls. It is not linked against any libc.

+
+  NOTES FOR LINUX/386
+    Please read the general Linux description first.
+
+    The generic linux/386 format decompresses to /tmp and needs /proc file
+    system support. It starts the decompressed program via the execve()
+    syscall.
+
+    Linux/386 is only selected if the specialized linux/elf386 and
+    linux/sh386 won't recognize a file.
+
+    Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after
+    uncompression.
+
+    How it works:
+
+      For files which are not ELF and not a script for a known &quot;-c&quot; shell,
+      UPX uses kernel execve(), which first requires decompressing to a
+      temporary file in the file system.  Interestingly -
+      because of the good memory management of the Linux kernel - this
+      often does not introduce a noticeable delay, and in fact there
+      will be no disk access at all if you have enough free memory as
+      the entire process takes places within the file system buffers.
+
+      A compressed executable consists of the UPX stub and an overlay
+      which contains the original program in a compressed form.
+
+      The UPX stub is a statically linked ELF executable and does
+      the following at program startup:
+
+        1) decompress the overlay to a temporary location in /tmp
+        2) open the temporary file for reading
+        3) try to delete the temporary file and start (execve)
+           the uncompressed program in /tmp using /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/fd/X as
+           attained by step 2)
+        4) if that fails, fork off a subprocess to clean up and
+           start the program in /tmp in the meantime
+
+      The UPX stub is about 1700 bytes long, partly written in assembler
+      and only uses kernel syscalls. It is not linked against any libc.
+
+    Specific drawbacks:
+
+      - You need additional free disk space for the uncompressed program
+        in your /tmp directory. This program is deleted immediately after
+        decompression, but you still need it for the full execution time
+        of the program.
+
+      - You must have /proc file system support as the stub wants to open
+        /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/exe and needs /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/fd/X. This also means that you
+        cannot compress programs that are used during the boot sequence
+        before /proc is mounted.
+
+      - Utilities like `top' will display numerical values in the process
+        name field. This is because Linux computes the process name from
+        the first argument of the last execve syscall (which is typically
+        something like /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/fd/3).
+
+      - Because of temporary decompression to disk the decompression speed
+        is not as fast as with the other executable formats. Still, I can see
+        no noticeable delay when starting programs like my ~3 MiB emacs (which
+        is less than 1 MiB when compressed :-).
+
+    Extra options available for this executable format:
+
+      --force-execve      Force the use of the generic linux/386 &quot;execve&quot;
+                          format, i.e. do not try the linux/elf386 and
+                          linux/sh386 formats.
+
+  NOTES FOR PS1/EXE
+    This is the executable format used by the Sony PlayStation (PSone), a
+    Mips R3000 based gaming console which is popular since the late '90s.
+    Support of this format is very similar to the Atari one, because of
+    nostalgic feelings of one of the authors.
+
+    Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after
+    uncompression, until further notice.
+
+    Maximum uncompressed size: ~1.89 / ~7.60 MiB.
+
+    Notes:
+
+      - UPX creates as default a suitable executable for CD-Mastering
+        and console transfer. For a CD-Master main executable you could also try
+        the special option &quot;--boot-only&quot; as described below.
+        It has been reported that upx packed executables are fully compatible with
+        the Sony PlayStation 2 (PS2, PStwo) and Sony PlayStation Portable (PSP) in
+        Sony PlayStation (PSone) emulation mode.
+
+      - Normally the packed files use the same memory areas like the uncompressed
+        versions, so they will not override other memory areas while unpacking.
+        If this isn't possible UPX will abort showing a 'packed data overlap'
+        error. With the &quot;--force&quot; option UPX will relocate the loading address
+        for the packed file, but this isn't a real problem if it is a single or
+        the main executable.
+
+    Extra options available for this executable format:
+
+      --all-methods       Compress the program several times, using all
+                          available compression methods. This may improve
+                          the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
+                          the default method gives the best results anyway.
+
+      --8-bit             Uses 8 bit size compression [default: 32 bit]
+
+      --8mib-ram          PSone has 8 MiB ram available [default: 2 MiB]
+
+      --boot-only         This format is for main exes and CD-Mastering only !
+                          It may slightly improve the compression ratio,
+                          decompression routines are faster than default ones.
+                          But it cannot be used for console transfer !
+
+      --no-align          This option disables CD mode 2 data sector format
+                          alignment. May slightly improves the compression ratio,
+                          but the compressed executable will not boot from a CD.
+                          Use it for console transfer only !

+                          the default filter gives the best results anyway.
+
+  NOTES FOR VMLINUZ/386
+    The vmlinuz/386 and bvmlinuz/386 formats take a gzip-compressed bootable
+    Linux kernel image (&quot;vmlinuz&quot;, &quot;zImage&quot;, &quot;bzImage&quot;), gzip-decompress it
+    and re-compress it with the UPX compression method.
+
+    vmlinuz/386 is completely unrelated to the other Linux executable
+    formats, and it does not share any of their drawbacks.
+
+    Notes:
+
+      - Be sure that &quot;vmlinuz/386&quot; or &quot;bvmlinuz/386&quot; is displayed
+      during compression - otherwise a wrong executable format
+      may have been used, and the kernel won't boot.
+
+    Benefits:
+
+      - Better compression (but note that the kernel was already compressed,
+      so the improvement is not as large as with other formats).
+      Still, the bytes saved may be essential for special needs like
+      boot disks.
+
+         For example, this is what I get for my 2.2.16 kernel:
+            1589708  vmlinux
+             641073  bzImage        [original]
+             560755  bzImage.upx    [compressed by &quot;upx -9&quot;]
+
+      - Much faster decompression at kernel boot time (but kernel
+        decompression speed is not really an issue these days).

+
+  NOTES FOR WATCOM/LE
+    UPX has been successfully tested with the following extenders: DOS4G,
+    DOS4GW, PMODE/W, DOS32a, CauseWay. The WDOS/X extender is partly
+    supported (for details see the file bugs BUGS).
+
+    DLLs and the LX format are not supported.
+
+    Extra options available for this executable format:
+
+      --le                Produce an unbound LE output instead of
+                          keeping the current stub.
+
+  NOTES FOR WIN32/PE
+    The PE support in UPX is quite stable now, but probably there are still
+    some incompatibilities with some files.
+
+    Because of the way UPX (and other packers for this format) works, you
+    can see increased memory usage of your compressed files because the
+    whole program is loaded into memory at startup. If you start several
+    instances of huge compressed programs you're wasting memory because the
+    common segments of the program won't get shared across the instances. On
+    the other hand if you're compressing only smaller programs, or running
+    only one instance of larger programs, then this penalty is smaller, but
+    it's still there.
+
+    If you're running executables from network, then compressed programs
+    will load faster, and require less bandwidth during execution.
+
+    DLLs are supported. But UPX compressed DLLs can not share common data
+    and code when they got used by multiple applications. So compressing
+    msvcrt.dll is a waste of memory, but compressing the dll plugins of a
+    particular application may be a better idea.
+
+    Screensavers are supported, with the restriction that the filename must
+    end with &quot;.scr&quot; (as screensavers are handled slightly different than
+    normal exe files).
+
+    UPX compressed PE files have some minor memory overhead (usually in the
+    10 - 30 KiB range) which can be seen by specifying the &quot;-i&quot; command line
+    switch during compression.
+
+    Extra options available for this executable format:
+
+     --compress-exports=0 Don't compress the export section.
+                          Use this if you plan to run the compressed
+                          program under Wine.
+     --compress-exports=1 Compress the export section. [DEFAULT]
+                          Compression of the export section can improve the
+                          compression ratio quite a bit but may not work
+                          with all programs (like winword.exe).
+                          UPX never compresses the export section of a DLL
+                          regardless of this option.
+
+      --compress-icons=0  Don't compress any icons.
+      --compress-icons=1  Compress all but the first icon.
+      --compress-icons=2  Compress all icons which are not in the
+                          first icon directory. [DEFAULT]
+      --compress-icons=3  Compress all icons.
+
+      --compress-resources=0  Don't compress any resources at all.
+
+      --keep-resource=list Don't compress resources specified by the list.
+                          The members of the list are separated by commas.
+                          A list member has the following format: I&lt;type[/name]&gt;.
+                          I&lt;Type&gt; is the type of the resource. Standard types
+                          must be specified as decimal numbers, user types can be
+                          specified by decimal IDs or strings. I&lt;Name&gt; is the
+                          identifier of the resource. It can be a decimal number
+                          or a string. For example:
+
+                          --keep-resource=2/MYBITMAP,5,6/12345
+
+                          UPX won't compress the named bitmap resource &quot;MYBITMAP&quot;,
+                          it leaves every dialog (5) resource uncompressed, and
+                          it won't touch the string table resource with identifier
+                          12345.
+
+      --force             Force compression even when there is an
+                          unexpected value in a header field.
+                          Use with care.
+
+      --strip-relocs=0    Don't strip relocation records.
+      --strip-relocs=1    Strip relocation records. [DEFAULT]
+                          This option only works on executables with base
+                          address greater or equal to 0x400000. Usually the
+                          compressed files becomes smaller, but some files
+                          may become larger. Note that the resulting file will
+                          not work under Windows 3.x (Win32s).
+                          UPX never strips relocations from a DLL
+                          regardless of this option.
+
+      --all-methods       Compress the program several times, using all

+DIAGNOSTICS
+    Exit status is normally 0; if an error occurs, exit status is 1. If a
+    warning occurs, exit status is 2.
+
+    UPX's diagnostics are intended to be self-explanatory.

+&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPX&lt;/strong&gt; is a portable, extendable, high-performance executable packer for
+several different executable formats. It achieves an excellent compression
+ratio and offers &lt;em&gt;*very*&lt;/em&gt; fast decompression. Your executables suffer
+no memory overhead or other drawbacks for most of the formats supported,
+because of in-place decompression.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;While you may use &lt;strong&gt;UPX&lt;/strong&gt; freely for both non-commercial and commercial
+executables (for details see the file LICENSE), we would highly
+appreciate if you credit &lt;strong&gt;UPX&lt;/strong&gt; and ourselves in the documentation,
+possibly including a reference to the &lt;strong&gt;UPX&lt;/strong&gt; home page. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

+&lt;p&gt;This is the first production quality release, and we plan that future 1.xx
+releases will be backward compatible with this version.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Please report all problems or suggestions to the authors. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

+&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;description&quot;&gt;DESCRIPTION&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPX&lt;/strong&gt; is a versatile executable packer with the following features:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - excellent compression ratio: compresses better than zip/gzip,
+      use UPX to decrease the size of your distribution !&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - very fast decompression: about 10 MiB/sec on an ancient Pentium 133,
+      about 200 MiB/sec on an Athlon XP 2000+.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - no memory overhead for your compressed executables for most of the
+      supported formats&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - safe: you can list, test and unpack your executables
+      Also, a checksum of both the compressed and uncompressed file is
+      maintained internally.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - universal: UPX can pack a number of executable formats:
+      * atari/tos
+      * bvmlinuz/386    [bootable Linux kernel]
+      * djgpp2/coff
+      * dos/com
+      * dos/exe
+      * dos/sys
+      * linux/386
+      * linux/elf386
+      * linux/sh386
+      * ps1/exe
+      * rtm32/pe
+      * tmt/adam
+      * vmlinuz/386     [bootable Linux kernel]
+      * vmlinux/386
+      * watcom/le (supporting DOS4G, PMODE/W, DOS32a and CauseWay)
+      * win32/pe (exe and dll)
+      * arm/pe (exe and dll)
+      * linux/elfamd64
+      * linux/elfppc32
+      * mach/elfppc32&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - portable: UPX is written in portable endian-neutral C++&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - extendable: because of the class layout it's very easy to support
+      new executable formats or add new compression algorithms&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - free: UPX can be distributed and used freely. And from version 0.99
+      the full source code of UPX is released under the GNU General Public
+      License (GPL) !&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;You probably understand now why we call &lt;strong&gt;UPX&lt;/strong&gt; the &quot;&lt;em&gt;ultimate&lt;/em&gt;&quot;
+executable packer.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;hr /&gt;
+&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;commands&quot;&gt;COMMANDS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;compress&quot;&gt;Compress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;This is the default operation, eg. &lt;strong&gt;upx yourfile.exe&lt;/strong&gt; will compress the file
+specified on the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;decompress&quot;&gt;Decompress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;All &lt;strong&gt;UPX&lt;/strong&gt; supported file formats can be unpacked using the &lt;strong&gt;-d&lt;/strong&gt; switch, eg.
+&lt;strong&gt;upx -d yourfile.exe&lt;/strong&gt; will uncompress the file you've just compressed.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;-t&lt;/strong&gt; command tests the integrity of the compressed and uncompressed
+data, eg. &lt;strong&gt;upx -t yourfile.exe&lt;/strong&gt; check whether your file can be safely
+decompressed. Note, that this command doesn't check the whole file, only
+the part that will be uncompressed during program execution. This means
+that you should not use this command instead of a virus checker.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;list&quot;&gt;List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;-l&lt;/strong&gt; command prints out some information about the compressed files
+specified on the command line as parameters, eg &lt;strong&gt;upx -l yourfile.exe&lt;/strong&gt;
+shows the compressed / uncompressed size and the compression ratio of
+&lt;em&gt;yourfile.exe&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;hr /&gt;
+&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;options&quot;&gt;OPTIONS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-q&lt;/strong&gt;: be quiet, suppress warnings&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-q -q&lt;/strong&gt; (or &lt;strong&gt;-qq&lt;/strong&gt;): be very quiet, suppress errors&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-q -q -q&lt;/strong&gt; (or &lt;strong&gt;-qqq&lt;/strong&gt;): produce no output at all&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--help&lt;/strong&gt;: prints the help&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--version&lt;/strong&gt;: print the version of &lt;strong&gt;UPX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--exact&lt;/strong&gt;: when compressing, require to be able to get a byte-identical file
+after decompression with option &lt;strong&gt;-d&lt;/strong&gt;. [NOTE: this is work in progress and is
+not supported for all formats yet. If you do care, as a workaround you can
+compress and then decompress your program a first time - any further
+compress-decompress steps should then yield byte-identical results
+as compared to the first decompressed version.]&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;[ ...to be written... - type `&lt;strong&gt;upx --help&lt;/strong&gt;' for now ]&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;hr /&gt;
+&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;compression_levels___tuning&quot;&gt;COMPRESSION LEVELS &amp; TUNING&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPX&lt;/strong&gt; offers ten different compression levels from &lt;strong&gt;-1&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;-9&lt;/strong&gt;,
+and &lt;strong&gt;--best&lt;/strong&gt;.  The default compression level is &lt;strong&gt;-8&lt;/strong&gt; for files
+smaller than 512 KiB, and &lt;strong&gt;-7&lt;/strong&gt; otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;ul&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Compression levels 1, 2 and 3 are pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Compression levels 4, 5 and 6 achieve a good time/ratio performance.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Compression levels 7, 8 and 9 favor compression ratio over speed.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Compression level &lt;strong&gt;--best&lt;/strong&gt; may take a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;/ul&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Note that compression level &lt;strong&gt;--best&lt;/strong&gt; can be somewhat slow for large
+files, but you definitely should use it when releasing a final version
+of your program.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Quick info for achieving the best compression ratio:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;ul&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Try &lt;strong&gt;upx --brute myfile.exe&lt;/strong&gt; or even &lt;strong&gt;upx --ultra-brute myfile.exe&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Try if &lt;strong&gt;--overlay=strip&lt;/strong&gt; works.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;For win32/pe programs there's &lt;strong&gt;--strip-relocs=0&lt;/strong&gt;. See notes below.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;/ul&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;hr /&gt;
+&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;overlay_handling_options&quot;&gt;OVERLAY HANDLING OPTIONS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Info: An &quot;overlay&quot; means auxiliary data attached after the logical end of
+an executable, and it often contains application specific data
+(this is a common practice to avoid an extra data file, though
+it would be better to use resource sections).&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPX&lt;/strong&gt; handles overlays like many other executable packers do: it simply
+copies the overlay after the compressed image. This works with some
+files, but doesn't work with others, depending on how an application
+actually accesses this overlayed data.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --overlay=copy    Copy any extra data attached to the file. [DEFAULT]&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --overlay=strip   Strip any overlay from the program instead of
+                    copying it. Be warned, this may make the compressed
+                    program crash or otherwise unusable.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --overlay=skip    Refuse to compress any program which has an overlay.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;hr /&gt;
+&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;environment&quot;&gt;ENVIRONMENT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;The environment variable &lt;strong&gt;UPX&lt;/strong&gt; can hold a set of default
+options for &lt;strong&gt;UPX&lt;/strong&gt;. These options are interpreted first and
+can be overwritten by explicit command line parameters.
+For example:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+    for DOS/Windows:   set UPX=-9 --compress-icons#0
+    for sh/ksh/zsh:    UPX=&quot;-9 --compress-icons=0&quot;; export UPX
+    for csh/tcsh:      setenv UPX &quot;-9 --compress-icons=0&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Under DOS/Windows you must use '#' instead of '=' when setting the
+environment variable because of a COMMAND.COM limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Not all of the options are valid in the environment variable -
+&lt;strong&gt;UPX&lt;/strong&gt; will tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;You can explicitly use the &lt;strong&gt;--no-env&lt;/strong&gt; option to ignore the
+environment variable.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;hr /&gt;

+&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;notes_for_atari_tos&quot;&gt;NOTES FOR ATARI/TOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;This is the executable format used by the Atari ST/TT, a Motorola 68000

+&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  Linux/386 support in UPX consists of 3 different executable formats,
+  one optimized for ELF executables (&quot;linux/elf386&quot;), one optimized
+  for shell scripts (&quot;linux/sh386&quot;), and one generic format
+  (&quot;linux/386&quot;).&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  We will start with a general discussion first, but please
+  also read the relevant docs for each of the individual formats.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  Also, there is special support for bootable kernels - see the
+  description of the vmlinuz/386 format.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;General user's overview&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  Running a compressed executable program trades less space on a
+  ``permanent'' storage medium (such as a hard disk, floppy disk,
+  CD-ROM, flash memory, EPROM, etc.) for more space in one or more
+  ``temporary'' storage media (such as RAM, swap space, /tmp, etc.).
+  Running a compressed executable also requires some additional CPU
+  cycles to generate the compressed executable in the first place,
+  and to decompress it at each invocation.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  How much space is traded?  It depends on the executable, but many
+  programs save 30% to 50% of permanent disk space.  How much CPU
+  overhead is there?  Again, it depends on the executable, but
+  decompression speed generally is at least many megabytes per second,
+  and frequently is limited by the speed of the underlying disk
+  or network I/O.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  Depending on the statistics of usage and access, and the relative
+  speeds of CPU, RAM, swap space, /tmp, and file system storage, then
+  invoking and running a compressed executable can be faster than
+  directly running the corresponding uncompressed program.
+  The operating system might perform fewer expensive I/O operations
+  to invoke the compressed program.  Paging to or from swap space
+  or /tmp might be faster than paging from the general file system.
+  ``Medium-sized'' programs which access about 1/3 to 1/2 of their
+  stored program bytes can do particularly well with compression.
+  Small programs tend not to benefit as much because the absolute
+  savings is less.  Big programs tend not to benefit proportionally
+  because each invocation may use only a small fraction of the program,
+  yet UPX decompresses the entire program before invoking it.
+  But in environments where disk or flash memory storage is limited,
+  then compression may win anyway.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  Currently, executables compressed by UPX do not share RAM at runtime
+  in the way that executables mapped from a file system do.  As a
+  result, if the same program is run simultaneously by more than one
+  process, then using the compressed version will require more RAM and/or
+  swap space.  So, shell programs (bash, csh, etc.)  and ``make''
+  might not be good candidates for compression.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  UPX recognizes three executable formats for Linux: Linux/elf386,
+  Linux/sh386, and Linux/386.  Linux/386 is the most generic format;
+  it accommodates any file that can be executed.  At runtime, the UPX
+  decompression stub re-creates in /tmp a copy of the original file,
+  and then the copy is (re-)executed with the same arguments.
+  ELF binary executables prefer the Linux/elf386 format by default,
+  because UPX decompresses them directly into RAM, uses only one
+  exec, does not use space in /tmp, and does not use /proc.
+  Shell scripts where the underlying shell accepts a ``-c'' argument
+  can use the Linux/sh386 format.  UPX decompresses the shell script
+  into low memory, then maps the shell and passes the entire text of the
+  script as an argument with a leading ``-c''.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;General benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - UPX can compress all executables, be it AOUT, ELF, libc4, libc5,
+    libc6, Shell/Perl/Python/... scripts, standalone Java .class
+    binaries, or whatever...
+    All scripts and programs will work just as before.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - Compressed programs are completely self-contained. No need for
+    any external program.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - UPX keeps your original program untouched. This means that
+    after decompression you will have a byte-identical version,
+    and you can use UPX as a file compressor just like gzip.
+    [ Note that UPX maintains a checksum of the file internally,
+      so it is indeed a reliable alternative. ]&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - As the stub only uses syscalls and isn't linked against libc it
+    should run under any Linux configuration that can run ELF
+    binaries.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - For the same reason compressed executables should run under
+    FreeBSD and other systems which can run Linux binaries.
+    [ Please send feedback on this topic ]&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;General drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - It is not advisable to compress programs which usually have many
+    instances running (like `sh' or `make') because the common segments of
+    compressed programs won't be shared any longer between different
+    processes.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - `ldd' and `size' won't show anything useful because all they
+    see is the statically linked stub.  Since version 0.82 the section
+    headers are stripped from the UPX stub and `size' doesn't even
+    recognize the file format.  The file patches/patch-elfcode.h has a
+    patch to fix this bug in `size' and other programs which use GNU BFD.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;General notes:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - As UPX leaves your original program untouched it is advantageous
+    to strip it before compression.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - If you compress a script you will lose platform independence -
+    this could be a problem if you are using NFS mounted disks.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - Compression of suid, guid and sticky-bit programs is rejected
+    because of possible security implications.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - For the same reason there is no sense in making any compressed
+    program suid.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - Obviously UPX won't work with executables that want to read data
+    from themselves. E.g., this might be a problem for Perl scripts
+    which access their __DATA__ lines.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - In case of internal errors the stub will abort with exitcode 127.
+    Typical reasons for this to happen are that the program has somehow
+    been modified after compression.
+    Running `strace -o strace.log compressed_file' will tell you more.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;

+&lt;p&gt;Please read the general Linux description first.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;The linux/elf386 format decompresses directly into RAM,
+uses only one exec, does not use space in /tmp,
+and does not use /proc.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Linux/elf386 is automatically selected for Linux ELF executables.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after uncompression.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;How it works:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  For ELF executables, UPX decompresses directly to memory, simulating
+  the mapping that the operating system kernel uses during exec(),
+  including the PT_INTERP program interpreter (if any).
+  The brk() is set by a special PT_LOAD segment in the compressed
+  executable itself.  UPX then wipes the stack clean except for
+  arguments, environment variables, and Elf_auxv entries (this is
+  required by bugs in the startup code of /lib/ld-linux.so as of
+  May 2000), and transfers control to the program interpreter or
+  the e_entry address of the original executable.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  The UPX stub is about 1700 bytes long, partly written in assembler
+  and only uses kernel syscalls. It is not linked against any libc.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Specific drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - For linux/elf386 and linux/sh386 formats, you will be relying on
+    RAM and swap space to hold all of the decompressed program during
+    the lifetime of the process.  If you already use most of your swap
+    space, then you may run out.  A system that is &quot;out of memory&quot;
+    can become fragile.  Many programs do not react gracefully when
+    malloc() returns 0.  With newer Linux kernels, the kernel
+    may decide to kill some processes to regain memory, and you
+    may not like the kernel's choice of which to kill.  Running
+    /usr/bin/top is one way to check on the usage of swap space.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Extra options available for this executable format:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  (none)&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;

+&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;notes_for_linux_sh386&quot;&gt;NOTES FOR LINUX/SH386&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Please read the general Linux description first.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Shell scripts where the underling shell accepts a ``-c'' argument
+can use the Linux/sh386 format.  &lt;strong&gt;UPX&lt;/strong&gt; decompresses the shell script
+into low memory, then maps the shell and passes the entire text of the
+script as an argument with a leading ``-c''.
+It does not use space in /tmp, and does not use /proc.&lt;/p&gt;

+use a known shell.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after uncompression.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;How it works:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  For shell script executables (files beginning with &quot;#!/&quot; or &quot;#! /&quot;)
+  where the shell is known to accept &quot;-c &lt;command&gt;&quot;, UPX decompresses
+  the file into low memory, then maps the shell (and its PT_INTERP),
+  and passes control to the shell with the entire decompressed file
+  as the argument after &quot;-c&quot;.  Known shells are sh, ash, bash, bsh, csh,
+  ksh, tcsh, pdksh.  Restriction: UPX cannot use this method
+  for shell scripts which use the one optional string argument after
+  the shell name in the script (example: &quot;#! /bin/sh option3\n&quot;.)&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  The UPX stub is about 1700 bytes long, partly written in assembler

+&lt;p&gt;Please read the general Linux description first.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;The generic linux/386 format decompresses to /tmp and needs
+/proc file system support. It starts the decompressed program
+via the &lt;code&gt;execve()&lt;/code&gt; syscall.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Linux/386 is only selected if the specialized linux/elf386
+and linux/sh386 won't recognize a file.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after uncompression.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;How it works:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  For files which are not ELF and not a script for a known &quot;-c&quot; shell,
+  UPX uses kernel execve(), which first requires decompressing to a
+  temporary file in the file system.  Interestingly -
+  because of the good memory management of the Linux kernel - this
+  often does not introduce a noticeable delay, and in fact there
+  will be no disk access at all if you have enough free memory as
+  the entire process takes places within the file system buffers.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  A compressed executable consists of the UPX stub and an overlay
+  which contains the original program in a compressed form.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  The UPX stub is a statically linked ELF executable and does
+  the following at program startup:&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+    1) decompress the overlay to a temporary location in /tmp
+    2) open the temporary file for reading
+    3) try to delete the temporary file and start (execve)
+       the uncompressed program in /tmp using /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/fd/X as
+       attained by step 2)
+    4) if that fails, fork off a subprocess to clean up and
+       start the program in /tmp in the meantime&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  The UPX stub is about 1700 bytes long, partly written in assembler
+  and only uses kernel syscalls. It is not linked against any libc.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Specific drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - You need additional free disk space for the uncompressed program
+    in your /tmp directory. This program is deleted immediately after
+    decompression, but you still need it for the full execution time
+    of the program.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - You must have /proc file system support as the stub wants to open
+    /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/exe and needs /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/fd/X. This also means that you
+    cannot compress programs that are used during the boot sequence
+    before /proc is mounted.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - Utilities like `top' will display numerical values in the process
+    name field. This is because Linux computes the process name from
+    the first argument of the last execve syscall (which is typically
+    something like /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/fd/3).&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - Because of temporary decompression to disk the decompression speed
+    is not as fast as with the other executable formats. Still, I can see
+    no noticeable delay when starting programs like my ~3 MiB emacs (which
+    is less than 1 MiB when compressed :-).&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Extra options available for this executable format:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --force-execve      Force the use of the generic linux/386 &quot;execve&quot;
+                      format, i.e. do not try the linux/elf386 and
+                      linux/sh386 formats.&lt;/pre&gt;

+&lt;p&gt;This is the executable format used by the Sony PlayStation (PSone),
+a Mips R3000 based gaming console which is popular since the late '90s.
+Support of this format is very similar to the Atari one, because of
+nostalgic feelings of one of the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after uncompression,
+until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Maximum uncompressed size: ~1.89 / ~7.60 MiB.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - UPX creates as default a suitable executable for CD-Mastering
+    and console transfer. For a CD-Master main executable you could also try
+    the special option &quot;--boot-only&quot; as described below.
+    It has been reported that upx packed executables are fully compatible with
+    the Sony PlayStation 2 (PS2, PStwo) and Sony PlayStation Portable (PSP) in

+  - Normally the packed files use the same memory areas like the uncompressed
+    versions, so they will not override other memory areas while unpacking.
+    If this isn't possible UPX will abort showing a 'packed data overlap'
+    error. With the &quot;--force&quot; option UPX will relocate the loading address
+    for the packed file, but this isn't a real problem if it is a single or
+    the main executable.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Extra options available for this executable format:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --all-methods       Compress the program several times, using all
+                      available compression methods. This may improve
+                      the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
+                      the default method gives the best results anyway.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --8-bit             Uses 8 bit size compression [default: 32 bit]&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --8mib-ram          PSone has 8 MiB ram available [default: 2 MiB]&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --boot-only         This format is for main exes and CD-Mastering only !
+                      It may slightly improve the compression ratio,
+                      decompression routines are faster than default ones.
+                      But it cannot be used for console transfer !&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --no-align          This option disables CD mode 2 data sector format
+                      alignment. May slightly improves the compression ratio,
+                      but the compressed executable will not boot from a CD.
+                      Use it for console transfer only !&lt;/pre&gt;

+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --all-filters       Compress the program several times, using all
+                      available preprocessing filters. This may improve
+                      the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
+                      the default filter gives the best results anyway.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;notes_for_vmlinuz_386&quot;&gt;NOTES FOR VMLINUZ/386&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;The vmlinuz/386 and bvmlinuz/386 formats take a gzip-compressed
+bootable Linux kernel image (&quot;vmlinuz&quot;, &quot;zImage&quot;, &quot;bzImage&quot;),
+gzip-decompress it and re-compress it with the &lt;strong&gt;UPX&lt;/strong&gt; compression method.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;vmlinuz/386 is completely unrelated to the other Linux executable
+formats, and it does not share any of their drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - Be sure that &quot;vmlinuz/386&quot; or &quot;bvmlinuz/386&quot; is displayed
+  during compression - otherwise a wrong executable format
+  may have been used, and the kernel won't boot.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - Better compression (but note that the kernel was already compressed,
+  so the improvement is not as large as with other formats).
+  Still, the bytes saved may be essential for special needs like
+  boot disks.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+     For example, this is what I get for my 2.2.16 kernel:
+        1589708  vmlinux
+         641073  bzImage        [original]
+         560755  bzImage.upx    [compressed by &quot;upx -9&quot;]&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  - Much faster decompression at kernel boot time (but kernel
+    decompression speed is not really an issue these days).&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  (none)&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Extra options available for this executable format:&lt;/p&gt;

+                      the compression ratio in some cases, but usually

+&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPX&lt;/strong&gt; has been successfully tested with the following extenders:
+  DOS4G, DOS4GW, PMODE/W, DOS32a, CauseWay.
+  The WDOS/X extender is partly supported (for details
+  see the file bugs BUGS).&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;DLLs and the LX format are not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Extra options available for this executable format:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --le                Produce an unbound LE output instead of
+                      keeping the current stub.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;notes_for_win32_pe&quot;&gt;NOTES FOR WIN32/PE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;The PE support in &lt;strong&gt;UPX&lt;/strong&gt; is quite stable now, but probably there are
+still some incompatibilities with some files.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Because of the way &lt;strong&gt;UPX&lt;/strong&gt; (and other packers for this format) works, you
+can see increased memory usage of your compressed files because the whole
+program is loaded into memory at startup.
+If you start several instances of huge compressed programs you're
+wasting memory because the common segments of the program won't
+get shared across the instances.
+On the other hand if you're compressing only smaller programs, or
+running only one instance of larger programs, then this penalty is
+smaller, but it's still there.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;If you're running executables from network, then compressed programs
+will load faster, and require less bandwidth during execution.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;DLLs are supported. But UPX compressed DLLs can not share common data and
+code when they got used by multiple applications. So compressing msvcrt.dll
+is a waste of memory, but compressing the dll plugins of a particular
+application may be a better idea.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Screensavers are supported, with the restriction that the filename
+must end with &quot;.scr&quot; (as screensavers are handled slightly different
+than normal exe files).&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;UPX compressed PE files have some minor memory overhead (usually in the
+10 - 30 KiB range) which can be seen by specifying the &quot;-i&quot; command
+line switch during compression.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Extra options available for this executable format:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+ --compress-exports=0 Don't compress the export section.
+                      Use this if you plan to run the compressed
+                      program under Wine.
+ --compress-exports=1 Compress the export section. [DEFAULT]
+                      Compression of the export section can improve the
+                      compression ratio quite a bit but may not work
+                      with all programs (like winword.exe).
+                      UPX never compresses the export section of a DLL
+                      regardless of this option.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --compress-icons=0  Don't compress any icons.
+  --compress-icons=1  Compress all but the first icon.
+  --compress-icons=2  Compress all icons which are not in the
+                      first icon directory. [DEFAULT]
+  --compress-icons=3  Compress all icons.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --compress-resources=0  Don't compress any resources at all.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --keep-resource=list Don't compress resources specified by the list.
+                      The members of the list are separated by commas.
+                      A list member has the following format: I&lt;type[/name]&gt;.
+                      I&lt;Type&gt; is the type of the resource. Standard types
+                      must be specified as decimal numbers, user types can be
+                      specified by decimal IDs or strings. I&lt;Name&gt; is the
+                      identifier of the resource. It can be a decimal number
+                      or a string. For example:&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+                      --keep-resource=2/MYBITMAP,5,6/12345&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+                      UPX won't compress the named bitmap resource &quot;MYBITMAP&quot;,
+                      it leaves every dialog (5) resource uncompressed, and
+                      it won't touch the string table resource with identifier
+                      12345.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --force             Force compression even when there is an
+                      unexpected value in a header field.
+                      Use with care.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --strip-relocs=0    Don't strip relocation records.
+  --strip-relocs=1    Strip relocation records. [DEFAULT]
+                      This option only works on executables with base
+                      address greater or equal to 0x400000. Usually the
+                      compressed files becomes smaller, but some files
+                      may become larger. Note that the resulting file will
+                      not work under Windows 3.x (Win32s).
+                      UPX never strips relocations from a DLL
+                      regardless of this option.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --all-methods       Compress the program several times, using all
+                      available compression methods. This may improve
+                      the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
+                      the default method gives the best results anyway.&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --all-filters       Compress the program several times, using all
+                      available preprocessing filters. This may improve
+                      the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
