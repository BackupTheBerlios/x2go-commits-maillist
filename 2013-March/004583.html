  With the desktopsharing function of X2go you can have full-access the desktop from somebody else like with programs as Remote Desktop. TeamViewer or LogMeIn. You can see an X2go session from somebody else, but you can also see a normal desktop.
  
  To do this you need access to port 22. So maybe you need to make a portforwarding on your router. Portforwarding is not discussed here on this page.

  After starting the application and some searching, you will find a new icon on your panel. On the top the icon it's blue, and under it is white with a red cross in it.

  After this you will login on the desktop of the other user. When your monitor is smaller than the other ones, it might be a bit difficult to read.
  
  Be aware, that by selecting 'shutdown' within the shared desktop, the remote system will be turned off!
