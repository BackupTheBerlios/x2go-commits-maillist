    - What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students? Please be as specific as possible.
      * To avoid students disappearing at all we will request a detailed time schedule and weekly reports. If possible we will try to schedule a chat with the mentor at least twice a week. The schedule will require the student to put some thought into whether he/her has sufficient time for the job. The weekly
report tries to countermeasure that a student slowly disappears. We will also have a close look at the sutdent's backgound, whether he is capable of managing the task. For this the Department of Computer Science 4 will provide its experience in supervising students.
