- ====== Installation ======
- :!: **Before you begin!**
- &gt; Please make sure that you have added the x2go repository to your package management system. The required steps are described here: [[adding the x2go repository (debian)]]!
- ===== Installing X2goserver-ONE (One Node Edition) =====
- 
- X2goserver-HOME is a meta package which will install an x2goserver for a ubuntu host. This meta package will take care of configuring your system and you'll be
able to use it after very short time. This &#8220;HOME edition&#8221;  takes care about all differences between debian and ubuntu. An unlimited number of users can access this PC &#8211; but you won't be able to use multi server features like &#8220;load balancing&#8221;. 
- 
- &lt;code&gt;
- # apt-get install x2goserver-one
- &lt;/code&gt;
- 
- Depending on the already installed packages, this command will add additional software to your computer. Please make sure that the following packages are installed: SSHFS, FUSE and SQLIGHT3. 
- Congratulations &#8211; you are now able to access your PC with the help of a configured x2goclient.
- 
- 
- :!: **Warning!**
- &gt; If you add further users to your system, please make sure that they are part of the posix group &#8220;x2gousers&#8221;, so that they are able to log into the X2go system.
- 
- :!: **Warning!**
- &gt; If you would like to use the file system sharing option of X2go, you'll need to make sure that those users also are part of the posix group &#8220;fuse&#8221;. This membership is
also needed by x2goprint.
- 
- :!: **Warning!**
- &gt; For Ubuntu x2go Server use as a remote desktop.
- 
- If you have been you seeing an x2go connection failure message to the Server &quot;a.b.c.d&quot; such as:
- 
- **Connection failed a.b.c.d: Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/home/userID/.ssh/known_hosts). Permission denied (publickey).**
- 
- Then the following may be the cause of your failure.  If you plan to log in to a remote Ubuntu x2go &quot;server&quot; machine (lets call it &quot;TargetDesktop&quot;) there is one SSH configuration setting (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) on TargetDesktop that you will want to change.   
- 
- Using a text editor as (nano, gedit) edit sshd_config and change the following.   The First will allow a user connection using a login ID and password (re Challenge/Response) from the x2go &quot;clients&quot;.   The Second is considered a generally good practice.
- 
- **1)** edit the TargetDesktop machine's /etc/ssh/sshd_config file:
- 
- **sudo gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config**
- 
-
//Ubuntu default is:  ChallengeResponseAuthentication no//
- 
- # Change to &quot;yes&quot; to enable challenge-response passwords (beware issues with
- # some PAM modules and threads)
- 
- **ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes**
- 
- **2)**  Since you are already editing your x2go server's ssh configuration another good security practice is to DENY direct Root Log-in.   
- 
- If you have configured your Server correctly you would already have made User(s) a member of the admin and adm groups which gives that user(s) the ability to use //sudo//.   With that there's really no need for direct root login so disable it.
- 
- NOTE: in this section of the sshd_config file the Ubuntu default is 'yes' for 
- //PermitRootLogin yes//  --&gt; Change it to &quot;no&quot;
- 
-   * Authentication
-   * LoginGraceTime 120
-   * **PermitRootLogin no**
-   * StrictModes yes
- 
- Save the file and exit the editor.
- 
- **Finally, remember to restart the SSH server on the TargetDesktop machine so both the changes take
effect** using the following command:
- 
- **sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart**
- 
- The first change above should now permit your x2go clients to log in.
