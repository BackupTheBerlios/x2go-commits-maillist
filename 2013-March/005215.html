+     * All selected mentors are active project supporters with lots of experience.
+     * Three of the four mentors work in university contexts, thus deal with students' businesses during their real life, as well.
+     * All selected mentors have been subscribed to our development mailing list for more than 3 years.

    - What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students? Please be as specific as possible.
      * To avoid students disappearing at all we will request a detailed time schedule and weekly reports.
        * The schedule will require the student to put some thought into whether
he/she has sufficient time for the job.
        * The weekly report tries to countermeasure that a student slowly disappears.
-     * To get a feeling for his/her progress, our project will be used as shared desktop and base for presentations
-     * If possible we will try to schedule a chat with the mentor at least twice a week.
-     * There will be a personal (video chat) interview with one of the mentors before the student applies
+     * To get a feeling for his/her progress, our project will be used as shared desktop and base for presentations.
+     * If possible we will try to schedule a public chat (IRC) with the mentor at least twice a week.
+     * There will be a personal (video chat) interview with one of the mentors before the student applies. Such an interview will be held with each potential applicant.
      * We will also have a close look at the student's backgound, whether she/he is capable of managing the task. For this the Department of Computer Science 4 will
provide its experience in supervising students.
    - What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors? Please be as specific as possible.
-     * All mentors have a professional interest that the project makes progress.
-     * If a mentor disappears one of the other mentors will take over.
+     * All mentors have a professional interest that the project makes progress and grows in the number of people who contribute to the project.
+     * If a mentor disappears one of the other mentors will take over. All chosen mentors are on eye-level. Each of them can fully substitute on of the other mentors in cases that he to leave due to e.g. personal, health or family issues.
    - What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program?
-     * Contacting the community means contacting possible employer in future
-     * Use Cases, feature requests and further needs of x2go are discussed inside our community 
-  
  * FIXME (Morty!) Students already interacting with the project and those who have a personal interest in the project. 
+     * Contacting the community means contacting possible employers in future.
+     * Performing the student &lt;-&gt; mentor meetings in public (IRC) is part of the training we provide to the students. In Open Source project communication skills are highly required and mostly have to be taught and trained.
+     * Use Cases, feature requests and further needs of X2Go are discussed inside our community--also in public.
+     * As there are already students participating in the X2Go project, other (non-German) students get the opportunity to network with students from two German universities

-     * Then, we offer peole who are more deeply interested in X2Go to take over responsibility in the project
-     * As the project has two Debian Developers on board, more knowledge and community insights are available to newcomers

+     * Then, we offer peole who are more deeply interested in X2Go to take over responsibility in the project.
+     * After someone has shown skills, interest and a kind of reliable stillness in the way he/she works, we will be happy to grant access to the development resources of the X2Go project.
+     * As the project has two Debian Developers on board, more knowledge and community insights are available to FOSS newcomers.
