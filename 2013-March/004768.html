  ===== Graphical interface ===== 
  
- After the installation of ''x2goclient'' an application link can be found in the menu of your Desktop Environment. On GNU/Linux systems it will be integrated into the ''Internet'' menu section.
+ After the [[doc:installation:x2goclient | installation]] of ''x2goclient'' an application link can be found in the menu of your Desktop
Environment. On GNU/Linux systems it will be integrated into the ''Internet'' menu section.
  
+ ==== Session creation ====
+ 
+ When you open the graphical user interface of the x2goclient, you'll be welcomed with a form to fill in your session details. The x2goclient manages sessions for each server you want to connect to. You can make settings for each one, and we'll go through the first together.
+ 
+    * At first you'll choose a name for you session. Choose something catchy, like &quot;work-serverroom&quot; or &quot;home-garage&quot;. 
+    * Then you'll need to enter how the server can be reached. You can enter an IP or a name for the host. If you choose a name, make sure it's resolvable from where you'll use the client. 
+    * Now set the username with which you are able to connect to the server. The user must have the right to log in to the server by SSH.
+    * You can change the port for the server, but most probably it's the default SSH port, 22.
+    * Now you can set, if you want to use
RSA or DSA Keys, which one to use. For example: &quot;/home/x2gouser/.ssh/id_rsa&quot;
+    * You could also just use a ssh-agent if you've got that available.
+    * There is also the availability to use a proxy to connect to the x2goserver for which you could provide a set of different credentials and key to authenticate against.
+ 
+ 
+ The next Tab shows your connection settings:
+ 
+    * You can adjust the bandwidth you have to be used by the x2goclient.
+    * Also there is an option to actively adjust the compression methods for the image processing.
+ 
+ 
+ On the Settings tab you will be able to adjust your clients configuration for convenient day-to-day usage:
+ 
+    * A whole set of Display settings can be used to configure the display for this session permanently.
+    * You can set the exact keyboard layout and the language to be used for it.
+    * The audio settings enable you to use the remote audio system locally and hear what would normally be heard on the remote side.
+   
* The last point in this tab enables the client side printing support to let you print locally from the remote side.
+ 
+ 
+ The last Tab for the session preferences is used to configure the folder sharing options:
+ 
+    * You can use the x2goclient to share folders between the local client and the remote side you will connect to. This enables you to share documents and files between both sides.
+ 
+ 
+ We now went through all the settings available to the specific session. Press okay to save it and you'll see it on the main window, in the session list.
  ===== Getting started (my first Session Profile) ===== 
  
  When you launch the ''x2goclient'' for the first time, it will start the ''new session'' dialogue automatically. On the first tab, fill out the ''Session Name'', type the IP of the host in the ''Host'' and add your username to the ''Login'' field. If you use a non-standard ssh port on your host, change that as well, in the ''SSH Port'' field.
