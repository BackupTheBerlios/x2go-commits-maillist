    - What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students? Please be as specific as possible.
      * To avoid students disappearing at all we will request a detailed time
schedule and weekly reports.
        * The schedule will require the student to put some thought into whether he/she has sufficient time for the job.
        * The weekly report tries to countermeasure that a student slowly disappears.
+     * To get a feeling for his/her progress, our project will be used as shared desktop and base for presentations
      * If possible we will try to schedule a chat with the mentor at least twice a week.
      * There will be a personal (video chat) interview with one of the mentors before the student applies
      * We will also have a close look at the student's backgound, whether she/he is capable of managing the task. For this the Department of Computer Science 4 will provide its experience in supervising students.
    - What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors? Please be as specific as possible.
      * All mentors have a professional interest that the project makes progress.
      * If a mentor disappears one of the other
mentors will take over.
    - What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program?
+     * Contacting the community means contacting possible employer in future
+     * Use Cases, feature requests and further needs of x2go are discussed inside our community
