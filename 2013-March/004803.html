legacy X2Go client ([[installation:x2goclient|X2Go Client]]) on the client-side systems then the installation of this package is sufficient.
  
  However, in 2011 many new features/capabilities were added to X2Go.
  
  One feature was an ''x2goserver-extensions'' package (Debian/Ubuntu) that we consider as a namespace for X2Go server contributions. For example, the Python X2Go implementation requires some scripts available in this package. If you work on coding some other X2Go client implementation you are invited to contribute your server extensions within this namespace.

  **NOTE:** -  this is a change from older versions of ''x2goserver'' installs where in previous versions the only requirement was to just execute ''sudo apt-get install x2goserver'' .

  X2Go server currently uses NXv3 based libraries and tools for the backend implementation of X2Go (graphical compression &amp; caching for low bandwidth connections).
  
- The individual ''x2goserver'' scripts do have (rudimentary) man pages. Some of the X2Go server scripts are used internally (by other X2Go server scripts), others are designed to be available to X2go client implementations (e.g. ''x2goruncommand'', ''x2gosuspend-session'', ''x2goterminate-session'', etc.).

  REQUEST TO X2Go USERS: For the improvement of the X2Go server manual pages we request everyone's help here.
  
  Task:
  
-    * recognize scripts that have to be available to clients (i.e. have to be in ''$PATH'') -&gt; ''$PREFIX/bin'' or ''$PREFIX/sbin''
-    * move other scripts to ''$PREFIX/lib/x2go''
     * improve manual page contents (what is the script for, what does it do, what values does it return, etc.)
