====== X2Go Desktop Bindings ======

To integrate X2Go fluently into your desktop, we provide desktop binding tools for the most common desktop environments. The following desktops are supported:

  * GNOME (v2.x)
  * KDE/Plasma (v4.x)
  * LXDE (v5.x)
  * Trinity (KDE3 fork, v3.5.x) -&gt; planned FIXME
  * XFCE4 (v4.x) -&gt; not planned yet, but requested by the community (help welcome)

:<i>!: **Note:**
</I>&gt;<i> The old project x2gokdebindings (desktop bindings for KDE3 as in Debian lenny and before) is discontinued and gets replaced by the bindings for the Trinity desktop.
</I>
The functionalities
offered by the desktop bindings are:

  * integrate functionalities around //Local Folder Sharing// (SSHFS mounted client shares) into the destkop
  * menu item for suspending X2Go sessions (not in LXDE)
  * remove non-remote desktop menu items (like suspend-2-RAM, suspend-2-Disk, shutdown and reboot menu items) from X2Go desktops

NOTE: All desktop binding packages have to be installed on the X2Go server(s).

:<i>!: **Before you begin!**
</I>&gt;<i> Installation of the desktop bindings are currently only provided as Debian/Ubuntu packages. Please make sure that you have added the x2go repository to your package management system. The required steps are described [[wiki:repositories:debian|here (Debian)]] and [[wiki:repositories:ubuntu|here (Ubuntu)]]
</I>
===== Desktop Bindings for GNOME (v2.x) =====

X2Go bindings for GNOME (package name: ''x2gognomebindings'') will add additional X2Go-related functionality to your GNOME Desktop. 

==== Installation ====

&lt;code&gt;
$ aptitude install
x2gognomebindings
&lt;/code&gt;

==== Usage ====

X2Go GNOME desktop bindings take care of mounted X2Go shares (local client folder sharing). If a client share is mounted via your X2Go client application, a desktop icon appears that allows the user to start GNOME'S file browser ''nautilus'' opening the mounted (SSHFS) share.

The X2Go GNOME desktop package defines a set of desktop icons and MIME types so that mounted client shares get associated to opening Nautilus.

The X2Go GNOME desktop bindings package also adds a context menu item that allows the X2Go session user to unmount shared client folders by right-clicking on their desktop icons. 

The X2Go GNOME desktop bindings package furtheron adds a //Systen// menu item to your GNOME panel. Users will be able to suspend their X2Go sessions with just a click on a menu entry: //System// -&gt; //Suspend X2Go Session//.

===== Desktop Bindings for KDE/Plasma (v4.x) =====

X2Go bindings for KDE/Plasma offer an X2Go plasmoid for the Plasma desktop
framework. The X2Go plasmoid adds additional X2Go-related functionality to your KDE/Plasma Desktop (package name: ''plasma-widget-x2go''). 

==== Installation ====

:<i>!: Note: this package has undergone some renamings in 2011; from x2goplasmoid to x2goplasmoidbindings, to plasma-widget-x2go.
</I>
&lt;code&gt;
$ aptitude install plasma-widget-x2go
&lt;/code&gt;


==== Usage ====

After the installation every KDE4/Plasma user on the server has the possibility to add the X2Go plasmoid applet to the desktop or to the taskbar (recommended). //<A HREF="Note://">Note://</A> the X2Go plasmoid is not available on the user desktops directly after installation, it __has__ to be integrated into the desktop by each individual user.

Once the X2Go plasmoid has been added to desktop or taskbar, the plasmoid will notify you about newly mounted client-side shared folders. You will be able to launch KDE4's file browser ''dolphin'' by left-clicking on one of these shares, you also have the possiblity to unmount/eject those shares.

At the
bottom of the X2Go plasmoid's applet box area, you have a link that allows you to suspend your current X2Go session.

FIXME, on the wishlist: Remove Suspend (to RAM) and Hibernate menu items from KDE4 start menu.

===== Desktop Bindings for LXDE (v5.x) =====

X2Go bindings for LXDE (package name: ''x2golxdebindings'') will add additional X2Go-related functionality to your LXDE Desktop. 

==== Installation ====

&lt;code&gt;
$ aptitude install x2golxdebindings
&lt;/code&gt;

==== Usage ====

X2Go LXDE desktop bindings take care of mounted X2Go shares (local client folder sharing). If a client share is mounted via your X2Go client application, a desktop icon appears that allows the user to start LXDE's file browser ''pcmanfm'' opening the mounted (SSHFS) share.

The X2Go LXDE bindings desktop package defines a set of desktop icons and MIME types so that mounted client shares get associated to opening ''pcmanfm''.

FIXME, currently not implemented, but on our wishlist: The X2Go LXDE desktop
bindings package also adds a context menu item that allows the X2Go session user to unmount shared client folders by right-clicking on their desktop icons. 

FIXME, currently not implemented, but on our wishlist: The X2Go LXDE desktop bindings package furtheron adds a menu item to your LXDE start menu. Users will be able to suspend their X2Go sessions with just a click on a menu entry: //Suspend X2Go Session//.

===== Desktop Bindings for Trinity (v3.5.x) =====

:<i>!: **WARNING:**
</I>&gt;<i> The desktop bindings for the Trinity desktop are planned and there already exists a Git project in the X2Go Git VCS. There already appears a package ''x2gotrinitybindings'' in the nightly-built package repositories (Debian/Ubuntu), but the code is very dysfunctional and not usable at all.
</I>
===== Desktop Bindings for XFCE4 (v4.x) =====

:<i>!: **WARNING:**
</I>&gt;<i> There currently are no desktop bindings for the XFCE4 desktop, but there has been a request from the community to work on that. Any help on this is
</I>appreciated, it might be fertile to adapt the ''x2gognomebindings'' package for that purpose. Please [[contact:start|contact]] the developers on the X2Go developers mailing list.
