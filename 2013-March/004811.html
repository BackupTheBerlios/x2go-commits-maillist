- ====== PyHoca-GUI  ======
- 
- The name PyHoca is a word play combining two powerful entities: Python and Phoca (mascot of X2go, Latin species name for seals).
- 
- PyHoca-GUI is a client implementation for X2Go using [[wiki:libs:python-x2go|the project's Python X2Go client API]] (a Python module). PyHoca-GUI uses wxPython for rendering graphical desktop elements (menus, dialog boxes etc.).
- 
- PyHoca-GUI is designed as a very minimal GUI that behaves very similar to GNOME's network manager applet (nm-applet). It
appears as a small Phoca icon (a little seal) that docks to your systray panel (also called notification area) and allows you to manage multiple X2go sessions simultaneously.
- 
- 
- ===== Command Line Arguments =====
- 
- PyHoca-GUI has a man page. Considering that it actually is a GUI there are quite some command line options to choose from.
- 
- On your GNU/Linux system execute 
- 
-      $ man pyhoca-gui
- 
- An always up-to-date html version of the pyhoca-gui man page can be be retrieved from the X2go Git repository: [[<A HREF="http://code.x2go.org/doc/pyhoca-gui/man/man1/pyhoca-gui.1.html|man">http://code.x2go.org/doc/pyhoca-gui/man/man1/pyhoca-gui.1.html|man</A> pyhoca-gui]].
- 
- 
- ===== Launching PyHoca-GUI =====
- 
- You can launch PyHoca-GUI by typing ''pyhoca-gui'' on the command line (from a terminal) or by starting it from your desktop's application menu (topic: Internet). 
- 
- PyHoca-GUI will appear on your desktop as a small icon that docks into your systray (as the GNOME applet for Network Manager does). Find this icon---it looks like a little
white seal on grey background.
- 
- Note that on Ubuntu 12.04 or later, the Unity interface does not allow PyHoca-gui to create the systray icon. To enable this, we need to edit the gsettings. To allow all applications in the systray, type this in the terminal.
- &lt;code&gt;
-   $ gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist &quot;['all']&quot;
- &lt;/code&gt;
- 
- If you would rather whitelist a set of applications, use this command instead, where YOUR_APPLICATION is 'pyhoca-gui'
- 
- &lt;code&gt;
- $ gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \
-       &quot;['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Mumble', 'Wine', 'Skype', 'hp-systray', 'YOUR_APPLICATION']&quot;
- &lt;/code&gt;
- 
- 
- ==== Profile Manager ====
- 
- PyHoca-GUI on Linux uses the same configuration files as X2Go Client. (The Windows version of X2Go Client writes its session profiles into HKCU of the Windows registry).
- Thus PyHoca-GUI should work out of the box for most setups and user profiles on a (Linux) system with a working X2Go Client
configuration.
- 
- If you are new to X2Go and try PyHoca-GUI for the first time, then you have to add a session profile for your (first) X2Go server by right-clicking on the PyHoca-GUI systray icon.
- 
- If you //right-click// on the PyHoca-GUI icon you are offered a sub-menu called //Profile Manager//. From there, you can create new X2Go session profiles and access all your already defined X2Go session profiles, as well.
- 
- 
- ==== Starting Sessions ====
- 
- The usage logic of PyHoca-GUI is a little bit different from that of X2Go Client. In PyHoca-GUI you //first// authenticate to an X2Go Server and //then// you start/resume sessions. It takes a little time to get used to that different concept, but you will soon get to like the advantages of this two-step session startup logic.
- 
- To start a PyHoca-GUI session //left-click// on the PyHoca icon and then choose **Authenticate X2go Server** to be presented with a list of existing session profiles. 
- 
- After you have
authenticated against one of your configured server session profiles, you can access the authenticated session profile by //left-clicking// the PyHoca-GUI icon. Navigate through the GUI's menu from there, most of it should be self-explanatory.
- 
- ===== Further Readings =====
- 
- For further readings, please also consult the README and TODO documentation files in the PyHoca-GUI source tree on the [[<A HREF="http://code.x2go.org/gitweb?p=pyhoca-gui.git;a=tree|X2Go">http://code.x2go.org/gitweb?p=pyhoca-gui.git;a=tree|X2Go</A> upstream Git site]].
