  ===== X2Go Application for GSOC2013 (Draft) =====
  
    - Describe your organization.
-     * FIXME
+     * The X2Go project is currently mainly driven by three commercial companies, namely (Heinz Alex, Mike) and supported by the Department of Computer Science 4 at the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg. 
    - Why is your organization applying to participate in Google Summer of Code 2013? What do you hope to gain by participating?
      * Our current interest is getting X2Go more known
internationally and getting more and more people involved
      * Some of the coding projects we offer to GSOC2013 students are features targetting for company setups
      * Thus, our intent is making X2Go usable in business context and large scale deployments

      * FIXME
    - What criteria did you use to select the mentors? Please be as specific as possible.
      * FIXME -&gt; Who will be mentoring??? (see above)
    - What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students? Please be as specific as possible.
-     * FIXME
+     * To avoid students disappearing at all we will request a detailed time schedule and weekly reports. If possible we will try to schedule a chat with the mentor at least twice a week. The schedule will require the student to put some thought into whether he/her has sufficient time for the job. The weekly report tries to countermeasure that a student slowly disappears. We will also have a close look at the sutdent's backgound, whether he
is capable of managing the task. For this the Department of Computer Science 4 will provide its experience in supervising students.
    - What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors? Please be as specific as possible.
-     * FIXME
+     * All mentors have a professional interest that the project makes progress. If a mentor disappears one of the other mentors will take over.
    - What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program?
-     * FIXME
+     * Students already interacting with the project and those who have a personal interest in the project. 
    - Are you a new organization who has a Googler or other organization to vouch for you? If so, please list their name(s) here.
      * FIXME
    - Are you an established or larger organization who would like to vouch for a new organization applying this year? If so, please list their name(s) here.
      * NO
    - What will you do to encourage
that your accepted students stick with the project after Google Summer of Code concludes?
