  ====== Communication Resources ======
  
- X2Go is mainly organized via mailing lists. Everybody can read content sent to the mailing lists in public without the need to join any web service. 
+ X2Go is mainly organized via IRC and mailing lists. We use IRC in cases where we need quick feedback on specific issues. IRC is also a place where you can get community support from. 
  
- If you want to ask a question or want to make suggestions, please feel free to join those lists you are interested in.
It is always a good idea to have a look inside the archives of a list to see if a topic has already been discussed. 
+ With the mailing lists, all content is public. The major (long term) discussions happen on the mailing lists. Also the dicussions from the bug tracker are cross-posted to one of the lists (x2go-dev ML). Before you can send to one of the X2Go mailing lists, you have to get a subscription. This is to avoid spam on the mailing lists.

+ Before asking questions, it is always a good idea to have a look inside the archives of a list to see if a topic has already been discussed and a solution to your question been provided. 
  
  As there are already people on the list who may have spent a lot of time working on this project, please be kind and think about what you are going to write
