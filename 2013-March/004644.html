- ====== Installation on Ubuntu 9.04 and 9.10 ======
- 
- &lt;note warning&gt;THIS PAGE IS OBSOLETE, DO NOT BELIEVE ITS CONTENT (ANYMORE)!!!&lt;/note&gt;
- 
- ===== Adding the needed Debian Repository to your system =====
- 
- 
- To get started you'll need to configure your local system to access the official X2go Debian repository. Please keep in mind that this installation manual will guide you through the installation on a Ubuntu 9.10 system. The repository will offer you packages for i386, amd64 and powerpc
architectures.
- 
- Commands printed inside the yellow boxes have to be entered in a command line client (**please use /bin/bash as operating shell**).
- 
- Before starting to edit your system configuration, you'll need to add the needed GPG keys of the repository. Please switch to an user which has administrator privileges on your system in your preferred command line client:
- 
- &lt;code&gt;
- # sudo su
- &lt;/code&gt;
- 
- The following commands will ensure that your system will be able to work with the repository key:
- 
- &lt;code&gt;
- # gpg --keyserver wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net --recv-keys C509840B96F89133
- # gpg -a --export C509840B96F89133 | apt-key add -
- &lt;/code&gt;
- 
- Please edit the file /etc/apt/sources.list with your preferred editor (in this example &#8220;vi&#8221;) and add the X2go repository as a new line:
- 
- &lt;code&gt;
- # vi /etc/apt/sources.list
- &lt;/code&gt;
- 
- White boxes like the one below will show you the content of text files. In this case the lines which have to be added to
&#8220;/etc/apt/sources.list&#8221;:
- 
- &lt;file&gt;
- # X2go Repository
- deb <A HREF="http://x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/">http://x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/</A> lenny main
- &lt;/file&gt;
- 
- Please perform an update on your debian package database:
- 
- &lt;code&gt;
- # apt-get update
- &lt;/code&gt;
- 
- After the update you should be able to access the x2go packages via the apt command:
- 
- &lt;code&gt;
- # apt-cache search x2go
- &lt;/code&gt;
- 
- Congratulations, you are now able to access the x2go packages. You may continue by installing x2goclient, x2goserver-one or x2goserver.
- ===== Installing X2goclient (GTK) =====
- 
- 
- 
- To get access to a x2goserver, you'll need to install x2goclient. If you are using Gnome, you can use x2goclient-gtk:
- 
- &lt;code&gt;
- # apt-get install x2goclient-gtk
- &lt;/code&gt;
- 
- x2goclient-gtk can be found in your Gnome menu listed as &#8220;internet&#8221; item.
- ===== Installing X2goserver-Home (Ubuntu Edition) =====
- 
- 
- X2goserver-Home is a meta package which will install an x2goserver for a single host. This meta package will take
care of configuring your system and you'll be able to use it after very short time. This Edition fits perfectly inside Ubuntu machines. An unlimited number of users can access this PC &#8211; but you won't be able to use multi server features like &#8220;load balancing&#8221;.
- 
- &lt;code&gt;
- # apt-get install x2goserver-home
- &lt;/code&gt;
- 
- Depending on the already installed packages, this command will add additional software to your computer. Please make sure that the following packages are installed: SSHFS, FUSE and SQLIGHT3.
- 
- Congratulations &#8211; you are now able to access your PC with the help of a configured x2goclient.
- 
- &lt;code&gt;
- # apt-get install sshfs
- &lt;/code&gt;
- 
- Warning!
- If you add further users to your system, please make sure that they are part of the posix group &#8220;x2gousers&#8221;, so that they are able to log into the X2go system.
- 
- 
- ===== Installing X2gognomebindings =====
- 
- 
- If you are using Gnome as serverside desktop, you can install the x2gognomebindings package
to get a icon to suspend sessions and to be able to access clientside filesystems.
- 
- &lt;code&gt;
- # apt-get install x2gognomebindings
- &lt;/code&gt;
- 
- Warning!
- If you are using KDE, please install x2gokdebindings instead.
- 
- 
- ===== Installing x2goprint (low bandwith capable print service) =====
- 
- Warning!
- This print service is intended for use on low bandwith networks &#8211; like internet connections or GSM connections. You won't need it inside normal networks &#8211; except for the case that you want to use printers which are directly connected to the (thin-)clients. X2goprint can be used with x2goserver-one, x2goserver-home and x2goserver (full features).
- 
- You'll need a running cups printing server to use X2goprint. You can use an existing cups server on your network or you can install a cups server on the same machine X2goserver is running on. The x2go cups engine is installed this way (in this example on the same machine):
- 
- &lt;code&gt;
- # apt-get install cups-x2go
-
&lt;/code&gt;
- 
- In any case, you'll need to install x2goprint on every server running X2goserver. You can install it by executing:
- 
- &lt;code&gt;
- # apt-get install x2goprint
- &lt;/code&gt;
- 
- The package &#8220;x2goprint&#8221; will add an user to the system and will configure the sudoers daemon by extending the file /etc/sudoers. After the installation, you are able to add a new printer to the cups system named &#8220;x2goprinter&#8221;. As device you should select the &#8220;Virtual x2go Printer&#8221;(vendor: &#8220;generic&#8221;/model: &#8220;Generic CUPS-X2GO Printer&#8221;).
- 
- You may configure further options by editing the file &#8220;/etc/cups/cups-x2go.conf&#8221;.
