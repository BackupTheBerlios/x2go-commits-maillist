Due to these circumstances in the future the X2go project will be upstream source for NXv3 libs for quite some distributions like Debian or Ubuntu.

contact me, so that we can discuss it and possibly correct errors in the given information).
  
  ==== What is the difference to LTSP? Why a free thin client environment? ====
  
  LTSP requires a high bandwidth on your network. It can efficiently be used in Local Area Networks (LANs) only. 
  
- However, X2go is not a mere solution for local area networks, but it also allows for the integration of a mobile network into the system. Nomachine&#8217;s NX libraries - used by X2go - enable the transport of whole desktop sessions over a narrow bandwith connection through the internet.

- Further bonuses of X2go are that you can pause a desktop session and take it to a different thin client for further use.

  ==== What are the packages x2goserver-home and x2goserver-one for? ====
  
- Both packages (x2goserver-home, x2goserver-one) are obsolete as of April 2011. They have been removed from the current .deb repositories and they should not be used anymore (in fact they break your system). On .deb based system they will automatically be uninstalled with an update of the x2goserver package.

- x2goserver currently does neither have any group membership restriction any more as former versions had. This may well be re-introduced, though, if
someone picks up work on that.

- The obsolete x2goserver-home package added all known users on the server system to the group x2gousers which made some people nervous when testing X2go on production systems :-/. For this reason we have dropped the auto-adding of users to groups in Apr 2011.

- ==== Do I need a postgres database to run x2goserver? ====
+ ==== Do I need a PostgreSQL database to run X2Go Server? ====
  
- No. The postgres database is only needed if you are planing to use more than one connected server (server array). By
default x2goserver installs with SQLite support enabled. To set up X2go with PostgreSQL as DB backend you have to edit the x2goserver's configuration in /etc/x2go.
