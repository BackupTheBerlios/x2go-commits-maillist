  ===== Starting a New Session =====
  
  When starting a new session the script called ''x2gostartagent'' gets executed on the server. ''x2gostartagent'' creates a new session in three phases:
  
-   - Find unique $DISPLAY number and unique session ID. This will insert a new session in the database.
+   - Find unique ''$DISPLAY'' number and unique session ID. This will insert a new session in the database.
    - Find free ports for sound, graphic, file sharing. After that the the database entry will get updated with these discovered values.
    - Start ''x2goagent'' (NX-like XServer): after that the database entry gets updated with the PID of the
''x2goagent'' process.
  
  CAVEAT for client implementations: if you query the session entry from the database with ''x2golistsessions''  some time between phases 1 and 3 some of the returned values (ports, agent PID) will not be set.
