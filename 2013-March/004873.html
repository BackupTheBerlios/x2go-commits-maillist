- ====== X2Go Desktop Bindings ======
- 
- To integrate X2Go fluently into your desktop, we provide desktop binding tools for the most common desktop environments. The following desktops are supported:
- 
-   * GNOME (v2.x)
-   * KDE/Plasma (v4.x)
-   * LXDE (v5.x)
-   * Trinity (KDE3 fork, v3.5.x) -&gt; planned FIXME
-   * XFCE4 (v4.x) -&gt; not planned yet, but requested by the community (help welcome)
- 
- :!: **Note:**
- &gt; The old project x2gokdebindings (desktop bindings for KDE3 as in
Debian lenny and before) is discontinued and gets replaced by the bindings for the Trinity desktop.
- 
- The functionalities offered by the desktop bindings are:
- 
-   * integrate functionalities around //Local Folder Sharing// (SSHFS mounted client shares) into the destkop
-   * menu item for suspending X2Go sessions (not in LXDE)
-   * remove non-remote desktop menu items (like suspend-2-RAM, suspend-2-Disk, shutdown and reboot menu items) from X2Go desktops
- 
- NOTE: All desktop binding packages have to be installed on the X2Go server(s).
- 
- :!: **Before you begin!**
- &gt; Installation of the desktop bindings are currently only provided as Debian/Ubuntu packages. Please make sure that you have added the x2go repository to your package management system. The required steps are described [[wiki:repositories:debian|here (Debian)]] and [[wiki:repositories:ubuntu|here (Ubuntu)]]
- 
- ===== Desktop Bindings for GNOME (v2.x) =====
- 
- X2Go bindings for GNOME (package name:
''x2gognomebindings'') will add additional X2Go-related functionality to your GNOME Desktop. 
- 
- ==== Installation ====
- 
- &lt;code&gt;
- $ aptitude install x2gognomebindings
- &lt;/code&gt;
- 
- ==== Usage ====
- 
- X2Go GNOME desktop bindings take care of mounted X2Go shares (local client folder sharing). If a client share is mounted via your X2Go client application, a desktop icon appears that allows the user to start GNOME'S file browser ''nautilus'' opening the mounted (SSHFS) share.
- 
- The X2Go GNOME desktop package defines a set of desktop icons and MIME types so that mounted client shares get associated to opening Nautilus.
- 
- The X2Go GNOME desktop bindings package also adds a context menu item that allows the X2Go session user to unmount shared client folders by right-clicking on their desktop icons. 
- 
- The X2Go GNOME desktop bindings package furtheron adds a //Systen// menu item to your GNOME panel. Users will be able to suspend their X2Go sessions with just a click on a
menu entry: //System// -&gt; //Suspend X2Go Session//.
- 
- ===== Desktop Bindings for KDE/Plasma (v4.x) =====
- 
- X2Go bindings for KDE/Plasma offer an X2Go plasmoid for the Plasma desktop framework. The X2Go plasmoid adds additional X2Go-related functionality to your KDE/Plasma Desktop (package name: ''plasma-widget-x2go''). 
- 
- ==== Installation ====
- 
- :!: Note: this package has undergone some renamings in 2011; from x2goplasmoid to x2goplasmoidbindings, to plasma-widget-x2go.
- 
- &lt;code&gt;
- $ aptitude install plasma-widget-x2go
- &lt;/code&gt;
- 
- 
- ==== Usage ====
- 
- After the installation every KDE4/Plasma user on the server has the possibility to add the X2Go plasmoid applet to the desktop or to the taskbar (recommended). //<A HREF="Note://">Note://</A> the X2Go plasmoid is not available on the user desktops directly after installation, it __has__ to be integrated into the desktop by each individual user.
- 
- Once the X2Go plasmoid has been added to desktop or taskbar, the plasmoid will notify you
about newly mounted client-side shared folders. You will be able to launch KDE4's file browser ''dolphin'' by left-clicking on one of these shares, you also have the possiblity to unmount/eject those shares.
- 
- At the bottom of the X2Go plasmoid's applet box area, you have a link that allows you to suspend your current X2Go session.
- 
- FIXME, on the wishlist: Remove Suspend (to RAM) and Hibernate menu items from KDE4 start menu.
- 
- ===== Desktop Bindings for LXDE (v5.x) =====
- 
- X2Go bindings for LXDE (package name: ''x2golxdebindings'') will add additional X2Go-related functionality to your LXDE Desktop. 
- 
- ==== Installation ====
- 
- &lt;code&gt;
- $ aptitude install x2golxdebindings
- &lt;/code&gt;
- 
- ==== Usage ====
- 
- X2Go LXDE desktop bindings take care of mounted X2Go shares (local client folder sharing). If a client share is mounted via your X2Go client application, a desktop icon appears that allows the user to start LXDE's file browser ''pcmanfm'' opening the mounted
(SSHFS) share.
- 
- The X2Go LXDE bindings desktop package defines a set of desktop icons and MIME types so that mounted client shares get associated to opening ''pcmanfm''.
- 
- FIXME, currently not implemented, but on our wishlist: The X2Go LXDE desktop bindings package also adds a context menu item that allows the X2Go session user to unmount shared client folders by right-clicking on their desktop icons. 
- 
- FIXME, currently not implemented, but on our wishlist: The X2Go LXDE desktop bindings package furtheron adds a menu item to your LXDE start menu. Users will be able to suspend their X2Go sessions with just a click on a menu entry: //Suspend X2Go Session//.
- 
- ===== Desktop Bindings for Trinity (v3.5.x) =====
- 
- :!: **WARNING:**
- &gt; The desktop bindings for the Trinity desktop are planned and there already exists a Git project in the X2Go Git VCS. There already appears a package ''x2gotrinitybindings'' in the nightly-built package repositories (Debian/Ubuntu), but the
code is very dysfunctional and not usable at all.
- 
- ===== Desktop Bindings for XFCE4 (v4.x) =====
- 
- :!: **WARNING:**
- &gt; There currently are no desktop bindings for the XFCE4 desktop, but there has been a request from the community to work on that. Any help on this is appreciated, it might be fertile to adapt the ''x2gognomebindings'' package for that purpose. Please [[contact:start|contact]] the developers on the X2Go developers mailing list.
