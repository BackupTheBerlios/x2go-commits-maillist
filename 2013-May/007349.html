+ You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License

+ .
+ GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+ Version 3, 19 November 2007
+ .
+ Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;<A HREF="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</A>&gt;
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+ .
+ Preamble
+ .
+ The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
+ software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
+ cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
+ .
+ The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
+ to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
+ our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
+ share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
+ software for all its users.
+ .
+ When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+ price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+ have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
+ them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
+ want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
+ free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
+ .
+ Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
+ with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
+ you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
+ and/or modify the software.
+ .
+ A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
+ improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
+ receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
+ incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
+ encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
+ software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
+ The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
+ letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
+ source code to the public.
+ .
+ The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
+ ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
+ to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
+ provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
+ users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
+ a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
+ code of the modified version.
+ .
+ An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
+ published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
+ a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
+ released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
+ this license.
+ .
+ The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+ modification follow.
+ .
+ TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+ .
+ 0. Definitions.
+ .
+ &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
+ .
+ &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
+ works, such as semiconductor masks.
+ .
+ &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
+ License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and
+ &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.
+ .
+ To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
+ in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
+ exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the
+ earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.
+ .
+ A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
+ on the Program.
+ .
+ To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
+ permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
+ infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
+ computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
+ distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
+ public, and in some countries other activities as well.
+ .
+ To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
+ parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
+ a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
+ .
+ An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;
+ to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
+ feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
+ tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
+ extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
+ work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
+ the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
+ menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
+ .
+ 1. Source Code.
+ .
+ The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work
+ for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source
+ form of a work.
+ .
+ A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official
+ standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
+ interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
+ is widely used among developers working in that language.
+ .
+ The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other
+ than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
+ packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
+ Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
+ Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
+ implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
+ &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
+ (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
+ (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
+ produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
+ .
+ The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all
+ the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
+ work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
+ control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
+ System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
+ programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
+ which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
+ includes interface definition files associated with source files for
+ the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
+ linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
+ such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
+ subprograms and other parts of the work.
+ .
+ The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
+ can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
+ Source.
+ .
+ The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
+ same work.
+ .
+ 2. Basic Permissions.
+ .
+ All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
+ copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
+ conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
+ permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
+ covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
+ content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
+ rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
+ .
+ You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
+ convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
+ in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
+ of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
+ with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
+ the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
+ not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
+ for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
+ and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
+ your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
+ .
+ Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
+ the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
+ makes it unnecessary.
+ .
+ 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
+ .
+ No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
+ measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
+ 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
+ similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
+ measures.
+ .
+ When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
+ circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
+ is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
+ the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
+ modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
+ users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
+ technological measures.
+ .
+ 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
+ .
+ You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
+ receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
+ appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
+ keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
+ non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
+ keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
+ recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
+ .
+ You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
+ and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
+ .
+ 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
+ .
+ You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
+ produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
+ terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+ .
+ a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
+ it, and giving a relevant date.
+ .
+ b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
+ released under this License and any conditions added under section
+ 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
+ &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.
+ .
+ c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
+ License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
+ License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
+ additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
+ regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
+ permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
+ invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
+ .
+ d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
+ Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
+ interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
+ work need not make them do so.
+ .
+ A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
+ works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
+ and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
+ in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
+ &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
+ used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
+ beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
+ in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
+ parts of the aggregate.
+ .
+ 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
+ .
+ You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
+ of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
+ machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
+ in one of these ways:
+ .
+ a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
+ (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
+ Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
+ customarily used for software interchange.
+ .
+ b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
+ (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
+ written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
+ long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
+ model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
+ copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
+ product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
+ medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
+ more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
+ conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
+ Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
+ .
+ c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
+ written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
+ alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
+ only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
+ with subsection 6b.
+ .
+ d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
+ place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
+ Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
+ further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
+ Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
+ copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
+ may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
+ that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
+ clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
+ Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
+ Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
+ available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
+ .
+ e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
+ you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
+ Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
+ charge under subsection 6d.
+ .
+ A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
+ from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
+ included in conveying the object code work.
+ .
+ A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any
+ tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
+ or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
+ into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
+ doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
+ product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a
+ typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
+ of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
+ actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
+ is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
+ commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
+ the only significant mode of use of the product.
+ .
+ &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,
+ procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
+ and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
+ a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
+ suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
+ code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
+ modification has been made.
+ .
+ If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
+ specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
+ part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
+ User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
+ fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
+ Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
+ by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
+ if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
+ modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
+ been installed in ROM).
+ .
+ The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
+ requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
+ for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
+ the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
+ network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
+ adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
+ protocols for communication across the network.
+ .
+ Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
+ in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
+ documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
+ source code form), and must require no special password or key for
+ unpacking, reading or copying.
+ .
+ 7. Additional Terms.
+ .
+ &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
+ License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
+ Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
+ be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
+ that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
+ apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
+ under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
+ this License without regard to the additional permissions.
+ .
+ When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
+ remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
+ it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
+ removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
+ additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
+ for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
+ .
+ Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
+ add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
+ that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
+ .
+ a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
+ terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
+ .
+ b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
+ author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
+ Notices displayed by works containing it; or
+ .
+ c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
+ requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
+ reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
+ .
+ d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
+ authors of the material; or
+ .
+ e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
+ trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
+ .
+ f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
+ material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
+ it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
+ any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
+ those licensors and authors.
+ .
+ All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further
+ restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
+ received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
+ governed by this License along with a term that is a further
+ restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
+ a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
+ License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
+ of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
+ not survive such relicensing or conveying.
+ .
+ If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
+ must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
+ additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
+ where to find the applicable terms.
+ .
+ Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
+ form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
+ the above requirements apply either way.
+ .
+ 8. Termination.
+ .
+ You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
+ provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
+ modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
+ this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
+ paragraph of section 11).
+ .
+ However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
+ license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
+ provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
+ finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
+ holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
+ prior to 60 days after the cessation.
+ .
+ Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
+ reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
+ violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
+ received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
+ copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
+ your receipt of the notice.
+ .
+ Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
+ licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
+ this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
+ reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
+ material under section 10.
+ .
+ 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
+ .
+ You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
+ run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
+ occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
+ to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
+ nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
+ modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
+ not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
+ covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
+ .
+ 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
+ .
+ Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
+ receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
+ propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
+ for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
+ .
+ An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an
+ organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
+ organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
+ work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
+ transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
+ licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
+ give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
+ Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
+ the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
+ .
+ You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
+ rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
+ not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
+ rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
+ (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
+ any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
+ sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
+ .
+ 11. Patents.
+ .
+ A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
+ License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
+ work thus licensed is called the contributor's &quot;contributor version&quot;.
+ .
+ A contributor's &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims
+ owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
+ hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
+ by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
+ but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
+ consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
+ purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant
+ patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
+ this License.
+ .
+ Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
+ patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
+ make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
+ propagate the contents of its contributor version.
+ .
+ In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express
+ agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
+ (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
+ sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a
+ party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
+ patent against the party.
+ .
+ If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
+ and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
+ to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
+ publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
+ then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
+ available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
+ patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
+ consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
+ license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have
+ actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
+ covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
+ in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
+ country that you have reason to believe are valid.
+ .
+ If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
+ arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
+ covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
+ receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
+ or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
+ you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
+ work and works based on it.
+ .
+ A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within
+ the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
+ conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
+ specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
+ work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
+ in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
+ to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
+ the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
+ parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
+ patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
+ conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
+ for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
+ contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
+ or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
+ .
+ Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
+ any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
+ otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
+ .
+ 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
+ .
+ If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+ otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+ excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
+ covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+ License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
+ not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
+ to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
+ the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
+ License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
+ .
+ 13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
+ .
+ .Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
+ Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
+ interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
+ supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
+ Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
+ from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
+ means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
+ shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
+ of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
+ following paragraph.
+ .
+ Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
+ permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
+ under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
+ combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
+ License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
+ but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
+ 3 of the GNU General Public License.
+ .
+ 14. Revised Versions of this License.
+ .
+ The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
+ the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
+ will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
+ address new problems or concerns.
+ .
+ Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
+ Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
+ Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the
+ option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
+ version or of any later version published by the Free Software
+ Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
+ GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
+ by the Free Software Foundation.
+ .
+ If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
+ versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
+ public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
+ to choose that version for the Program.
+ .
+ Later license versions may give you additional or different
+ permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
+ author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
+ later version.
+ .
+ 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
+ .
+ THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
+ APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
+ HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY
+ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
+ THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
+ PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
+ IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
+ ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+ .
+ 16. Limitation of Liability.
+ .
+ IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
+ WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
+ THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
+ GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
+ USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
+ DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
+ PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
+ EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
+ SUCH DAMAGES.
+ .
+ 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
+ .
+ If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
+ above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
+ reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
+ an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
+ Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
+ copy of the Program in return for a fee.
+ .
